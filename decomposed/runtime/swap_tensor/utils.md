* `SwapBufferPool`: A class managing a pool of `SwapBuffer` objects, enabling efficient tensor swapping and allocation. Importance: **[High]**

### Highlights



1. **Tensor swapping functionality**: The code provides functions for swapping tensors to and from NVMe storage devices, which is useful for managing memory in deep learning applications. The `swap_in_tensors` and `swap_out_tensors` functions handle the I/O operations using asynchronous reads and writes.
2. **Classes for managing swap buffers**: The `SwapBuffer` class represents a buffer that can store tensors, managing their allocation, deallocation, and swap operations. The `SwapBufferPool` class extends this functionality by managing a pool of `SwapBuffer` instances, allowing for efficient use of memory and swapping.
3. **Utility functions**: The `print_object` function is a debugging tool that prints the attributes of an object, and `get_sized_buffer` and `get_sized_buffers` functions are used to get tensors of a specific size from a given buffer or a list of buffers.
4. **Error checking and assertions**: The code uses assertions to ensure that certain conditions are met, such as checking if a buffer has enough space for a tensor or if the asynchronous I/O operations complete successfully.
5. **Dependency on DeepSpeed**: The code is part of the DeepSpeed library, which is a high-performance training library for PyTorch. It uses `deepspeed.utils.logging`, `deepspeed.accelerator`, and `deepspeed.comm` modules, indicating that it is designed to work within the DeepSpeed framework.
