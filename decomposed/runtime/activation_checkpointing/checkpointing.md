### Highlights



1. **Activation Checkpointing**: The code is designed to reduce memory consumption during deep learning training by checkpointing and recomputing intermediate activations. It supports partitioning activations, CPU checkpointing, and contiguous memory checkpointing.
2. **Random Number Generator (RNG) State Management**: The code includes a `CudaRNGStatesTracker` class to manage and synchronize random number generator states across GPUs, ensuring reproducibility during checkpointing.
3. **Memory Management**: The code has functions to manage memory buffers for contiguous memory checkpointing, such as `contiguous_data_buffers`, `data_offsets`, `contiguous_size_buffers`, and `size_offsets`.
4. **Utility Functions**: The code provides utility functions like `detach_variable`, `_set_cuda_rng_state`, `get_cuda_rng_tracker`, `model_parallel_cuda_manual_seed`, and `model_parallel_reconfigure_tp_seed` to handle tensor manipulation, random number generator state, and model parallel seed initialization.
5. **Custom Checkpointing Function**: The `CheckpointFunction` class is a custom autograd function that implements the checkpointing logic, including saving and restoring activation states, managing random number generator states, and handling partitioned or CPU checkpointed activations.
