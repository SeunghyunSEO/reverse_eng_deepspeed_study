### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `TorchCheckpointEngine`: This is the main class that extends the `CheckpointEngine` class from `deepspeed.runtime.checkpoint_engine.checkpoint_engine`. It provides a specific implementation for saving and loading checkpoints using PyTorch. Importance: **[High]**
* `__init__`: The constructor for `TorchCheckpointEngine`, which initializes the class with `config_params`. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `create`: A method that logs a message indicating a checkpoint is about to be saved with a given `tag`. Importance: **[Low]**
* `save`: Saves a `state_dict` using PyTorch's `torch.save` function at the specified `path`. Importance: **[High]**
* `load`: Loads a checkpoint from a `path` using PyTorch's `torch.load` function, and returns the loaded data. Importance: **[High]** 
* `commit`: Logs a message indicating a checkpoint with a given `tag` is ready. Returns `True`. Importance: **[Low]**

This file, `torch_checkpoint_engine.py`, is part of the DeepSpeed library. It implements a checkpoint engine specifically for PyTorch, providing functionality to save and load model checkpoints during training. The `TorchCheckpointEngine` class encapsulates the necessary operations for checkpoint management, such as saving, loading, and marking the completion of a checkpoint. The methods are designed to be simple and log progress information using the `logger` utility.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Inheritance**: The `TorchCheckpointEngine` class inherits from the `CheckpointEngine` class, indicating that it is a specialized implementation of a checkpoint engine tailored for PyTorch.
2. **Import statements**: The code imports necessary modules, such as `torch`, `logger`, and `log_dist` from `deepspeed.utils`, which are used for logging and managing the checkpointing process.
3. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method is defined, which calls the `super().__init__(config_params)`, ensuring that the parent class's initialization is executed.
4. **Core methods**: The class defines four methods that are crucial for checkpointing:
5. **create**: This method logs a message indicating that a checkpoint with a specific `tag` is about to be saved.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a class for managing PyTorch checkpoints
class TorchCheckpointEngine:
    # Initialize the class with optional configuration parameters
    def __init__(self, config_params=None):
        # Inherit from the base CheckpointEngine class
        super().__init__(config_params)

    # Announce the start of saving a checkpoint with a specific tag
    def create(self, tag):
        # Log the message on rank 0
        log_message(f"[Torch] Checkpoint {tag} is about to be saved!", ranks=[0])

    # Save a state dictionary to a specified file path
    def save(self, state_dict, path):
        # Log the start of the saving process
        log_info(f"[Torch] Saving {path}...")
        
        # Perform the actual saving using PyTorch's save function
        torch.save(state_dict, path)
        
        # Log the completion of the saving process
        log_info(f"[Torch] Saved {path}.")

    # Load a checkpoint from a specified file path
    def load(self, path, map_location=None):
        # Log the start of the loading process
        log_info(f"[Torch] Loading checkpoint from {path}...")
        
        # Load the checkpoint using PyTorch's load function
        partition = torch.load(path, map_location=map_location)
        
        # Log the completion of the loading process
        log_info(f"[Torch] Loaded checkpoint from {path}.")
        
        # Return the loaded checkpoint
        return partition

    # Declare a checkpoint with a specific tag as ready
    def commit(self, tag):
        # Log the checkpoint readiness
        log_info(f"[Torch] Checkpoint {tag} is ready now!")
        
        # Return a success indicator (True)
        return True
```
