### Summary



* `__init__.py`: This is the initialization file for the `comm` module within the `runtime` directory. It is responsible for setting up the package and potentially importing necessary components for the DeepSpeed communication module. Importance : **[Low]** (It's a standard Python package structure file)
* `DeepSpeedEngine`: This class is not explicitly defined in the provided code, but it is likely a core class in the `comm` module, responsible for managing the communication aspects of the DeepSpeed distributed training engine. Importance : **[High]** (Assuming its existence based on DeepSpeed's typical architecture)
* `allgather_object`: A utility function for gathering objects across all processes in a distributed setup. Importance : **[Medium]**
* `broadcast_object`: A utility function for broadcasting an object from one process to all processes in a distributed setup. Importance : **[Medium]**
* `reduce_object`: A utility function for reducing an object across all processes in a distributed setup, typically used for aggregating gradients. Importance : **[High]** 

This codebase is part of the DeepSpeed library, focusing on communication utilities for distributed training in deep learning. It provides essential functions for data exchange and synchronization between multiple processes, which is crucial for efficient distributed training. The `comm` module likely contains implementations of collective communication operations like all-reduce, all-gather, and broadcast, which are optimized for performance and scalability. These operations are fundamental to distributed training frameworks like DeepSpeed, allowing the coordination of model parameters and gradients across multiple GPUs or nodes.

### Highlights



1. **File Location and Name**: The code is from a Python file named `__init__.py` located in the `runtime/comm/` directory. This file is typically used to initialize a Python package, making the `comm` module importable.
2. **Copyright and License Information**: The code has copyright information indicating that it is owned by Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. This is important for understanding the usage and distribution rights associated with the code.
3. **Commented Credits**: There is a reference to the "DeepSpeed Team," suggesting that this code is part of the DeepSpeed project, which is a popular open-source deep learning optimization library. The second comment further confirms this, crediting the "Microsoft DeepSpeed Team."
4. **Module Documentation**: The triple-quoted string `'''Copyright The Microsoft DeepSpeed Team'''` is a multi-line comment that could also serve as module documentation. It's not standard documentation format (usually `"""` is used), but it conveys additional information about the module's origin.
5. **Blank Lines and Formatting**: The code is well-formatted with blank lines separating different sections, which improves readability. This is a good practice in code organization.
