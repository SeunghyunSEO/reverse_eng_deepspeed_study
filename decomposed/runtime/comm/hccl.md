### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `HcclBackend`: This is the primary class that manages communication using the HCCL (Heterogeneous Computing Collective Communication Library) backend. It initializes the communication group and provides methods for data gathering and all-reduce operations. Importance: **[High]**
* `my_igather`: A custom implementation of an in-place gather operation. It collects data from multiple ranks and stores it in a specified buffer at the root rank. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `my_gather`: A custom gather operation that collects data from all ranks and stores it in a buffer at the root rank. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `compressed_allreduce`: A method that performs a compressed all-reduce operation, which is a communication-efficient way to average tensors across all ranks. It uses sign-bit packing and unpacking techniques to reduce the amount of data transferred. Importance: **[High]**
* `__init__`: The constructor for the `HcclBackend` class, initializes the communication group based on the provided Multi-Process-Unit (MPU) or creates a new one if not provided. Importance: **[Medium]** 

This file `hccl.py` is part of the DeepSpeed library, and it implements a communication backend using HCCL for distributed training in deep learning. The primary focus is on efficient data gathering and all-reduce operations, which are essential for distributed training. The code is optimized for tensor communication, particularly with the use of a compressed all-reduce algorithm to reduce communication overhead.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Import statements**: The code imports necessary libraries for its functionality, such as `numpy`, `torch`, `torch_npu`, and `deepspeed.comm`.
2. **HcclBackend class**: This is the main class that encapsulates methods related to collective communication operations using HCCL (Heterogeneous Computing Collective Communications Library). It initializes a communication group and provides methods for custom gather and allreduce operations.
3. **__init__ method**: The constructor initializes the class with a communication group and sets the rank and size of the current process within the group. It handles the case where an `mpu` (Multi-Process Unit) object is provided or not.
4. **my_igather and my_gather methods**: These methods implement custom gather operations, which are used to gather data from multiple ranks into a single rank. They use `dist.isend` and `dist.irecv` for non-blocking communication.
5. **compressed_allreduce method**: This is a custom implementation of an allreduce operation that performs compression and error compensation. It is designed to work with tensors, normalizing and packing/unpacking sign bits for efficient communication. It involves multiple communication phases using `dist.all_to_all_single`, `dist.all_gather`, and handles different tensor sizes across workers.
