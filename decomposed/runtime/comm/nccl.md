### Summary



* `NcclBackend`: This is the primary class in the file, implementing an NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) backend for communication in a distributed DeepSpeed setup. It handles operations like gathering and all-reducing tensors with compression. Importance : **[High]**
* `my_igather`: A custom implementation of an "immediate gather" operation, which collects data from multiple ranks and sends it to a root rank. Importance : **[Medium]**
* `my_gather`: A custom gather operation that collects data from all ranks and places it at the root rank. Importance : **[Medium]**
* `compressed_allreduce`: A method that performs an all-reduce operation with compression, which is a key part of distributed training for reducing communication overhead. Importance : **[High]**
* `CupyBackend`: A class imported from `deepspeed.runtime.compression.cupy`, which provides compression functionality using CuPy for GPU tensors. Importance : **[Low]** (imported but not defined in this file)

This file is part of the DeepSpeed library, specifically focusing on communication using the NCCL backend. It provides utilities for distributed communication, such as gathering and all-reducing tensors, with an emphasis on compression to optimize performance on GPUs. The `NcclBackend` class encapsulates these operations and is designed to work with the DeepSpeed framework.

### Highlights



1. **Library Imports**: The code imports several libraries, including `torch`, `deepspeed`, `cupy`, and `numpy`, which are essential for tensor operations, distributed communication, and GPU acceleration.
2. **NcclBackend Class**: The main focus of the code is the `NcclBackend` class, which is designed for communication and compression operations in a distributed environment. It initializes a communication group, handles gather and scatter operations, and implements a compressed allreduce method.
3. **Compressed Allreduce**: The `compressed_allreduce` method is a custom implementation of an allreduce operation that involves compression using the `CupyBackend`. It handles tensor normalization, sign compression, and all-to-all communication for both worker and server error updates.
4. **Distributed Communication**: The code uses PyTorch's `dist` module for distributed communication, specifically `irecv`, `isend`, `all_to_all_single`, `all_gather`, and `all_reduce` operations, which are crucial for distributed training.
5. **Error Handling and Compression**: The code manages worker and server errors, scales them, and compresses the data using the `CupyBackend` for efficient communication. It also checks for a minimum required PyTorch version to ensure compatibility with certain features.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import relevant_libraries

# Define CupyBackend class for compression
class CupyBackend:
    # Define methods for compression and decompression

# Define NcclBackend class for NCCL-based communication
class NcclBackend:
    def __init__(self, mpu=None):
        # Initialize the communication group and rank
        # Set up compression backend and check for minimum torch version

    def my_igather(self, rank, size, group, sendbuf, recvbuf, root):
        # Implement an asynchronous gather operation with NCCL

    def my_gather(self, rank, size, group, sendbuf, recvbuf, root):
        # Implement a synchronous gather operation with NCCL

    def compressed_allreduce(self, buffer_m, worker_error, server_error, local_rank):
        # Normalize and prepare input tensor
        # Check for boolean tensor support and compress signs
        # Initialize communication buffers

        # Phase 1: Gather signs and scales
        # Perform all-to-all and all-gather operations for signs and scales

        # Unpack and compensate server error
        # Normalize and update server_error

        # Phase 2: Gather server signs and scales
        # Perform all-gather operations for server signs and scales

        # Update buffer_m with compensated server error
        # Reshape and trim buffer_m if needed

        # Return the updated buffer_m tensor
```
