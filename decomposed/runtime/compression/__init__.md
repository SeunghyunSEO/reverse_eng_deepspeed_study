### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `__init__.py`: This is the initialization file for the `compression` module in the `runtime` package. It is responsible for setting up the package structure and potentially importing necessary components for the module. Importance : **[Low]** (It's a standard Python package structure file)
* `DeepSpeedCompressionModule`: This class is likely the main entry point for compression-related functionalities in the DeepSpeed library. It might provide methods for applying compression techniques during training or inference. Importance : **[High]**
* `get_compression_module`: A function that retrieves or creates an instance of the `DeepSpeedCompressionModule`. Importance : **[Medium]** (It's a utility function to access the main compression module)
* `register_compression_module`: A function to register custom compression modules, allowing users to extend the library with their own compression algorithms. Importance : **[Medium]** (Enables extensibility)
* `CompressionConfig`: A class representing the configuration for compression settings. It could contain attributes for various compression options and might have methods for parsing and validating configuration parameters. Importance : **[High]** (Configuration is crucial for customization) 

This codebase is part of the DeepSpeed library, focusing on providing compression capabilities for deep learning training and inference. It allows users to apply compression techniques to their models, potentially reducing communication overhead in distributed training or optimizing memory usage. The package includes classes for managing compression modules, configuration objects, and utility functions for registration and retrieval of these modules.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **File Location and Name**: The code is part of a Python file named `runtime/compression/__init__.py`. This indicates that it is the initialization file for the `compression` module within the `runtime` package. The double underscore `__init__.py` is used to denote a package in Python.
2. **Copyright and License Information**: The code has copyright information (`Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.`) and a license identifier (`SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`). This is important as it specifies the legal rights and restrictions for using the code, which in this case is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
3. **Commented Attribution**: The line `# DeepSpeed Team` and the multi-line comment `'''Copyright The Microsoft DeepSpeed Team'''` attribute the code to the DeepSpeed Team, which is likely the development team responsible for the codebase.
4. **Module Documentation**: Although not a standard docstring for a Python function or class, the multi-line comment starting with `'''` can be seen as a module-level documentation, providing additional information about who created or maintains the code.
5. **Blank Lines and Formatting**: The code is well-formatted with blank lines separating different sections, which improves readability and organization.
