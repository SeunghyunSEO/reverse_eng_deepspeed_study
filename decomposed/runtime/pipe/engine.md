### Highlights



1. **Pipeline Parallelism**: The code is designed for training deep learning models using pipeline parallelism, which involves dividing the model into stages and processing data sequentially across multiple GPUs. The `PipelineEngine` class extends the `DeepSpeedEngine` and manages the data flow between stages.
2. **Communication and Synchronization**: The code makes use of the `p2p` module for peer-to-peer communication between GPUs, and `dist` (distributed communication) for all-reduce operations. It also includes methods for sending and receiving tensors between stages, as well as handling data parallelism and model parallelism.
3. **Timing and Performance Monitoring**: The code has built-in timers for measuring the performance of different parts of the pipeline, such as forward and backward passes, and data input/output. It also provides functionality for logging and monitoring memory usage and throughput.
4. **Configuration and Optimization**: The engine supports various configurations, like activation checkpointing, gradient accumulation, and ZeRO optimization stages. It also handles adjustments to the batch size and gradient accumulation steps, and supports curriculum learning.
5. **Memory Management**: The code includes methods for managing memory, such as allocating and deallocating tensors, and monitoring memory usage. It also has mechanisms to handle partitioned tensors for efficient communication between pipeline stages.
