### Summary



* `__init__`: Initializes the `CurriculumScheduler` object, setting up the initial state with required configurations. Importance: **[High]**
* `get_current_difficulty`: Retrieves the current difficulty level. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `set_current_difficulty`: Sets the current difficulty level. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `set_custom_get_difficulty`: Assigns a custom schedule function for curriculum learning. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `get_state`: Returns the current state of the scheduler. Importance: **[Low]**

### Highlights



1. **Class Definition**: The code defines a class `CurriculumScheduler` which is responsible for managing the curriculum learning process. It inherits from `object` and is part of a data pipeline.
2. **Config Validation**: The `__init__` method thoroughly validates the input configuration, ensuring that required keys like `CURRICULUM_LEARNING_MIN_DIFFICULTY`, `CURRICULUM_LEARNING_MAX_DIFFICULTY`, and `CURRICULUM_LEARNING_SCHEDULE_TYPE` are present. It also checks and initializes the schedule configuration based on the chosen schedule type.
3. **Schedule Types**: The class supports different curriculum learning schedules: `CURRICULUM_LEARNING_SCHEDULE_FIXED_DISCRETE`, `CURRICULUM_LEARNING_SCHEDULE_FIXED_ROOT`, `CURRICULUM_LEARNING_SCHEDULE_FIXED_LINEAR`, and `CURRICULUM_LEARNING_SCHEDULE_CUSTOM`. Each schedule type has its own configuration requirements and methods for calculating the current difficulty.
4. **Methods**: The class provides methods to get and set the current difficulty, update the difficulty based on global steps, and retrieve or set the scheduler's state. It also has private methods for calculating difficulty based on the chosen schedule type.
5. **Error Handling**: The class raises a `RuntimeError` when an unsupported schedule type is encountered, ensuring proper handling of invalid configurations.
