### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `find_fit_int_dtype`: Given a minimum and maximum value, this function returns the most appropriate numpy integer data type that can accommodate the range. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `split_index`: Splits an index range (start_idx to end_idx) into `num_partitions` equal or nearly equal parts. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `split_dataset`: Splits a dataset into worker and thread-specific splits based on the number of workers, worker ID, and number of threads. Importance: **[High]**
* `create_mmap_dataset_builder`: Creates an instance of `MMapIndexedDatasetBuilder` with the given file name and data type. Importance: **[High]**
* `close_mmap_dataset_builder`: Closes and finalizes the `MMapIndexedDatasetBuilder`, saving the index file. Importance: **[High]** 

This file is part of a data pipeline for DeepSpeed, a deep learning acceleration library. It provides utility functions for data sampling and handling, specifically focused on creating and managing memory-mapped indexed datasets. The functions help with data type selection, splitting datasets for parallel processing, and managing the creation and finalization of dataset builders for efficient storage and access.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Imports**: The code imports necessary libraries, including `math`, `numpy`, `logger` from `deepspeed.utils`, and `MMapIndexedDatasetBuilder` from a relative import `indexed_dataset`. These imports indicate the dependencies for the functions defined in the module.
2. **Utility Functions**: The module provides several utility functions for data processing and management:
3. `find_fit_int_dtype`: This function determines the most appropriate integer data type (numpy dtype) based on the given minimum and maximum values. It checks if the values fit within the range of unsigned or signed integers of different bit widths.
4. `split_index`: This function splits a range of indices into equal-sized partitions (or as close to equal as possible) given a number of partitions. It's useful for distributing work across multiple processes or threads.
5. `split_dataset`: This function takes a dataset, the total number of workers, the worker ID, and the number of threads per worker, and returns the index ranges for each worker and thread. It's a higher-level function that combines `split_index` to handle distributed data processing.
