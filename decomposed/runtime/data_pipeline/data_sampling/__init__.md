### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `__init__.py`: This is an initialization file for the `data_sampling` module within the `data_pipeline` package. It is responsible for organizing and importing necessary components from other files in the package. Importance : **[Low]** (It's a standard Python package structure file)
* `data_sampling`: The codebase likely contains functions and classes for handling data sampling, which is a crucial step in data preprocessing for machine learning tasks. It might include methods for selecting representative subsets of data, stratified sampling, or other sampling techniques. Importance : **[High]** (As it's the main functionality of the module)
* `Microsoft Copyright and SPDX-License-Identifier`: These are copyright and license declarations, indicating that the code is owned by Microsoft and licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Importance : **[Low]** (Legal information)
* `DeepSpeed Team`: The codebase is developed by the DeepSpeed team, which is a high-performance deep learning acceleration library. Importance : **[Low]** (Credits)
* `Copyright The Microsoft DeepSpeed Team`: Another mention of the developers, possibly for clarity. Importance : **[Low]** (Credits)

The main purpose of this file is to set up the `data_sampling` module within the `data_pipeline` package, providing a structure for organizing related code and making it importable. The actual implementation of data sampling methods and classes is likely found in other files within the package, which are imported and made accessible through this `__init__.py` file.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **File Structure**: The code is part of a Python package, specifically `runtime/data_pipeline/data_sampling`. This tells us that it's likely a module responsible for data sampling within a larger data processing pipeline in a project, possibly related to deep learning or machine learning.
2. **License Information**: The code includes a copyright notice and a SPDX-License-Identifier, which is `Apache-2.0`. This indicates that the code is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0, allowing for free use, modification, and distribution with certain conditions.
3. **Attribution**: The code mentions the "DeepSpeed Team" and "The Microsoft DeepSpeed Team". DeepSpeed is an efficient deep learning training acceleration library, and this code is likely part of that project. The mention of Microsoft suggests that the project is either developed or maintained by Microsoft.
4. **Comment Structure**: The code uses triple quotes (`'''`) to create multi-line comments, which is a common practice in Python for writing docstrings. However, the content within these docstrings seems to be a mix of documentation and legal notices, which is atypical. Normally, docstrings provide a description of the function, class, or module they precede.
5. **No Actual Code**: The provided code snippet only contains comments and licensing information, not any executable Python code. This is typical for an `__init__.py` file in a Python package, which is often left empty or used for importing sub-modules or setting up the package.
