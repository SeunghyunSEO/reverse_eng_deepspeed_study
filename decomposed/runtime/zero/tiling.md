This file `tiling.py` is part of the DeepSpeed library and focuses on implementing a memory-efficient linear layer called `TiledLinear`. It is designed to work with the ZeRO-3 optimization strategy, which aims to reduce memory usage in distributed deep learning by partitioning and offloading tensors. The `TiledLinear` class splits the input and output dimensions into tiles, processing them sequentially, and allowing inactive tiles to be partitioned and offloaded. The `split_tensor_along_last_dim` function is a utility used to split tensors, and `TiledLinearReturnBias` is a specialized version of `TiledLinear` for handling bias parameters in a specific way.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Tiling Functionality**: The code introduces a custom `TiledLinear` class, which is a replacement for `torch.nn.Linear` that supports tiling to reduce memory requirements. It breaks the input and output dimensions of a linear layer into tiles that can be processed sequentially, making it suitable for large models with ZeRO-3 optimization.
2. **Splitting and Combining Tensors**: The `split_tensor_along_last_dim` function is used to split tensors along the last dimension, and the `TiledLinear` class has methods to split, reduce, and combine tensor splits as needed for tiling operations.
3. **Module and Initialization**: The `TiledLinear` class extends `torch.nn.Module` and has an `__init__` method that takes various parameters for controlling tiling, such as `in_splits`, `out_splits`, and `input_is_already_split`. It initializes a list of smaller linear layers for each tile and has a `copy_params_from` method for initializing with pre-defined parameters.
4. **Forward Pass**: The `forward` method handles the computation for the tiling operation. It splits the input if needed, applies the individual linear layers, and combines the outputs. There are also helper methods `_split_global_input`, `_reduce_local_output`, and `_combine_output_splits` for managing the tiling process.
5. **Specialized Variant**: The `TiledLinearReturnBias` class is a variant of `TiledLinear` that returns both the tensor output and the bias parameter, which is useful for certain architectures like Megatron-LM.
