### Summary



* `from .git_version_info_installed import *`: This line is commented out and is meant to be used when the package is installed. It imports version information generated during the package build process. Importance: **[None]** (as it's a comment)
* `try-except`: The block attempts to import version information from a module that is generated during installation. If not found, it falls back to reading a `version.txt` file or assigns default values. Importance: **[High]** (as it's responsible for determining the package version)
* `version`: A variable that stores the package version, either from the file or the default value. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `git_hash`: Stores the Git hash of the repository, defaulting to '[none]'. Importance: **[Low]** (metadata)
* `git_branch`: Stores the Git branch of the repository, defaulting to '[none]'. Importance: **[Low]** (metadata) 
* `from .ops.op_builder.all_ops import ALL_OPS`: Imports a dictionary of all available DeepSpeed operations. Importance: **[Medium]** (for checking installed and compatible ops)
* `installed_ops`: A dictionary to track which DeepSpeed operations are installed. Importance: **[Medium]** (status tracking)
* `compatible_ops`: A dictionary to track which DeepSpeed operations are compatible. Importance: **[Medium]** (status tracking)
* `torch_info`: A dictionary containing information about the installed PyTorch version, CUDA, and HIP versions. Importance: **[Medium]** (dependency information)

This Python file, `git_version_info.py`, is part of the DeepSpeed library. It is responsible for providing version and dependency information about the package, including the Git version hash and branch, installed and compatible DeepSpeed operations, and PyTorch details. The file is used to determine the package's state, whether it's installed or in a development environment, and to gather metadata for the library's components. This information is crucial for proper package management and version tracking.

### Highlights



1. **Module Import and Version Handling**: The code attempts to import `git_version_info_installed` from a relative module, which is likely populated during the installation process (using `setup.py`). If not available, it falls back to reading a `version.txt` file or sets default values for the version, git hash, and git branch.
2. **Conditional Logic**: The use of `try-except` block to handle the case where the module is not found, indicating that the code is designed to work both in installed and non-installed (e.g., development) environments.
3. **Reading `version.txt`**: The script reads the `version.txt` file to get the version information when the package is not installed, ensuring that version information is available even in checkouts that haven't been installed.
4. **Op Builder and Op Status**: The import of `ALL_OPS` from `ops.op_builder.all_ops` and the creation of `installed_ops` and `compatible_ops` dictionaries suggests that this code is related to tracking the availability and compatibility of certain operations within the DeepSpeed library.
5. **Torch Information**: The `torch_info` dictionary is defined with default versions for the torch, CUDA, and HIP, which likely represents the current environment's PyTorch and GPU compatibility information.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# git_version_info.py
# Copyright and license information

# Import or generate version information

try:
    # Attempt to import version information from installed package
    from .git_version_info_installed import *  # noqa: F401 # type: ignore
except ModuleNotFoundError:
    # If not installed, read version from file or set default
    version = read_version_from_file('version.txt') or "0.0.0"
    git_hash = '[none]'
    git_branch = '[none]'

    # Initialize dictionaries for DeepSpeed operations and compatibility
    installed_ops = initialize_dict_with_keys(ALL_OPS.keys(), default=False)
    compatible_ops = initialize_dict_with_keys(ALL_OPS.keys(), default=False)

    # Initialize PyTorch information
    torch_info = {
        'version': "0.0",
        'cuda_version': "0.0",
        'hip_version': "0.0"
    }
