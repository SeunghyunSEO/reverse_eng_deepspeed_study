### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `instrument_w_nvtx`: This is a decorator function that instruments a given function with NVIDIA Visual Profiler Toolkit (NVTX) range markers. It records an NVTX range at the start and end of the function call, which helps in profiling and analyzing the performance of the function within a larger computational context. Importance : **[High]**
* `get_accelerator`: This function is not defined in this file, but it is referenced. It is likely an external function that returns an accelerator object, which is used for managing hardware accelerators like GPUs in a DeepSpeed context. Importance : **[Indirect, as it's an external dependency]**
* `wrapped_fn`: This is an inner function created by the `instrument_w_nvtx` decorator. It is responsible for calling the original function with the NVTX range tracking. Importance : **[Low, as it's an internal implementation detail]**
* `NVTX`: Although not directly defined in this file, NVTX is the underlying toolkit being used for performance profiling. Importance : **[Indirect, as it's an external tool]**
* `func`: This is a parameter in `instrument_w_nvtx`, representing the function to be decorated. Importance : **[Low, as it's a function input]** 

This file, `utils/nvtx.py`, is about providing a decorator function `instrument_w_nvtx` to enable performance profiling using NVIDIA's NVTX toolkit. The decorator allows developers to easily add profiling markers to their code, which can be visualized and analyzed in tools like NVIDIA Visual Profiler, to optimize the performance of DeepSpeed-powered applications. The code is part of the DeepSpeed library, which is a high-performance training library for deep learning models.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **File and Module**: The code is part of a Python file named `nvtx.py`, which is likely part of a larger library or project called "DeepSpeed."
2. **Copyright and License**: The code carries a copyright notice for Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, indicating the terms under which the code can be used, modified, and distributed.
3. **Authorship**: The code is attributed to the "DeepSpeed Team," suggesting that this is a team effort and the code is part of the DeepSpeed project.
4. **Decorator Function**: The main functionality of the code is a decorator function called `instrument_w_nvtx`. This function is designed to wrap another function (`func`) and adds the behavior of recording an NVTX (NVIDIA Visual Profiler Tools eXtension) range around the call to the wrapped function. This is useful for performance profiling and analysis, particularly in GPU-intensive applications.
5. **get_accelerator()**: The `get_accelerator()` function is called to interact with the accelerator (potentially a GPU) and is used to manage the NVTX range. It is part of the `deepspeed.accelerator` module, which suggests that the code is specifically designed to work with the DeepSpeed library for optimizing deep learning computations.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a module for utility functions related to NVTX (Non-Virtual Terminal eXtensions)

# Import required components
from accelerator_module import get_accelerator

# Define a decorator function to instrument functions with NVTX range
def instrument_with_nvtx(func):
    """
    A decorator that wraps a function to record an NVTX range during its execution.

    Args:
        func (callable): The function to be instrumented.

    Returns:
        wrapped_fn (callable): The instrumented function.
    """

    # Define an inner function (wrapped_fn) that will replace the original function
    def wrapped_function(*args, **kwargs):
        # Start the NVTX range with the function's qualified name
        start_nvtx_range = get_accelerator().start_range(func.__qualname__)

        # Call the original function with the provided arguments and keyword arguments
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)

        # End the NVTX range
        end_nvtx_range = get_accelerator().end_range()

        # Return the result of the original function
        return result

    # Return the wrapped function
    return wrapped_function
```
