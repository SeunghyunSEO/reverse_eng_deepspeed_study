### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `DeprecatedException`: This is a custom exception class that is raised when a deprecated feature or functionality is used. Importance : **[Low]**
* `cli_main`: Not present in the provided code, but it's a common pattern in Python scripts to have a main function for command-line interface (CLI) entry point. It's usually used to wrap the `main` function and handle command-line arguments. Importance : **[N/A]** (mentioned for context)
* `default_inference_config`: Not present in the provided code, but it's a common function name for providing a default configuration for DeepSpeed inference. Importance : **[N/A]** (mentioned for context)
* `DeepSpeedOptimizerCallable`: Not present in the code, but it's likely a class or function that helps create a callable for DeepSpeed's optimizer. Importance : **[N/A]** (mentioned for context)
* `DeepSpeedSchedulerCallable`: Not present in the code, but it's likely a class or function that helps create a callable for DeepSpeed's learning rate scheduler. Importance : **[N/A]** (mentioned for context) 

**File Summary:**

The codebase provided is a small Python file named `utils/exceptions.py`. It contains a single custom exception class, `DeprecatedException`, which is used to signal that a particular feature or functionality has been deprecated. This file is part of the DeepSpeed library, which is a highly optimized library for deep learning training, and it focuses on handling deprecation-related errors gracefully. The other functions and classes mentioned are not present in the code snippet but are common components in a DeepSpeed context, typically dealing with optimizer and scheduler configurations, as well as CLI handling.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **File and Module**: The code is part of a Python module named `utils/exceptions.py`, which suggests it contains exception classes specifically related to utility or error-handling functionality within a larger project.
2. **License Information**: The code includes a copyright notice and a SPDX-License-Identifier, indicating that the code is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. This is important for understanding the terms under which the code can be used, modified, and distributed.
3. **Authorship**: The comment mentions the "DeepSpeed Team," which is likely the team responsible for developing the code or the project it belongs to. This provides context about the code's origin and maintainers.
4. **Custom Exception Class**: The code defines a custom exception class called `DeprecatedException`. This class inherits from the built-in `Exception` class in Python, which means it is a specialized error that can be raised when a deprecated feature or functionality is used.
5. **Functionality**: The `DeprecatedException` class doesn't have any additional methods or attributes, which is typical for simple exception classes. It serves as a signal to the programmer that a certain behavior is no longer supported or recommended.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# File: utils/exceptions.py

# Comment: Define a custom exception class for deprecation warnings.
#          This class inherits from the built-in Exception class.

class DeprecatedException:  # Define a new class called DeprecatedException
    def __init__(self):  # Initialize the class
        super().__init__("This functionality has been deprecated.")  # Inherit the base Exception message

    # Optional: Add a custom method or attribute to provide additional information
    # def get_deprecated_message(self):
    #     return "The method or feature you are using is no longer supported and will be removed in the future."

# Comment: The class definition ends here, and no other functionality is present in the file.
# This class can be raised when a deprecated functionality is encountered in the codebase.

# Example usage:
# try:
#     use_deprecated_feature()
# except DeprecatedException as de:
#     print(de)
#     # Handle deprecation gracefully or log the warning
```
