This file, `utils/types.py`, is part of a deep learning library, likely DeepSpeed. It defines a set of enums (int-based enumerations) to standardize and categorize common components used in deep learning models, specifically activation functions and normalization types. These enums are essential for the library's internal operations, enabling clear communication between different parts of the codebase about the specific activation function or normalization layer being used. The `GATED_ACTIVATION_TYPES` list is a utility that groups gated activation functions for convenience.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **File and Module**: The code is part of a Python module named `utils/types.py`, which suggests it contains utility types and definitions for a larger project, possibly related to DeepSpeed, as indicated by the copyright and team information.
2. **Import**: The `enum` module is imported, specifically the `IntEnum` class, which is used to create enumerated types with integer values.
3. **Custom Enums**: The code defines two custom `IntEnum` classes:
4.   - **ActivationFuncType**: This enum represents different activation functions used in neural networks, like GELU, ReLU, and gated variants. The `UNKNOWN` value is often used as a default or placeholder.
5.   - **NormType**: This enum represents different normalization techniques, such as LayerNorm, GroupNorm, and RMSNorm, commonly used in deep learning.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a module for utility functions related to types in deep learning
module utils.types:

    # Import Enum class from the 'enum' module for creating enumerated types
    from enum import Enum

    # Define an enumerated class ActivationFuncType with integer values
    class ActivationFuncType(Enum):
        # Unknown activation function
        UNKNOWN = 0
        # Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU)
        GELU = 1
        # Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
        ReLU = 2
        # Gated GELU activation
        GATED_GELU = 3
        # Gated SiLU activation
        GATED_SILU = 4

        # Create a constant list of gated activation types
    GATED_ACTIVATION_TYPES = [
        ActivationFuncType.GATED_GELU,
        ActivationFuncType.GATED_SILU,
    ]

    # Define another enumerated class NormType with integer values
    class NormType(Enum):
        # Unknown normalization method
        UNKNOWN = 0
        # Layer Normalization
        LayerNorm = 1
        # Group Normalization
        GroupNorm = 2
        # Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm)
        RMSNorm = 3
```
