### Summary



* `PDSH_LAUNCHER`: A constant representing the Parallel Distributed Shell (pdsh) launcher. Importance: **[Low]**
* `PDSH_MAX_FAN_OUT`: The maximum number of parallel processes for the pdsh launcher. Importance: **[Low]**
* `OPENMPI_LAUNCHER`: A constant representing the OpenMPI launcher. Importance: **[Low]**
* `MPICH_LAUNCHER`: A constant representing the MPICH launcher. Importance: **[Low]**
* `IMPI_LAUNCHER`: A constant representing the Intel MPI (IMPI) launcher. Importance: **[Low]**

### Highlights



1. **File Information**: The code is part of a Python file named `launcher/constants.py`, which suggests it contains constants related to launching processes, possibly in a distributed computing context.
2. **Copyright and Licensing**: The code has a copyright notice and a license identifier (`SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`), indicating that it is governed by the Apache License 2.0.
3. **Authorship**: The code is attributed to the "DeepSpeed Team," which is likely the development team responsible for the DeepSpeed library, a popular deep learning optimization framework.
4. **Launchers**: The code defines several constants representing different distributed computing launchers, such as `PDSH_LAUNCHER`, `OPENMPI_LAUNCHER`, `MPICH_LAUNCHER`, `IMPI_LAUNCHER`, `SLURM_LAUNCHER`, and `MVAPICH_LAUNCHER`. These constants are likely used to specify which distributed computing system or parallel job scheduler to use.
5. **Specific Configuration**: There's a constant `MVAPICH_TMP_HOSTFILE` that points to a temporary hostfile for MVAPICH, which is a high-performance MPI implementation. This suggests that the code is tailored to work with MVAPICH and requires a hostfile for proper configuration.
