### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **DeepSpeed Communication Package**: The code is part of the DeepSpeed library, specifically the communication package (`deepspeed.comm`). It provides communication functionalities for distributed deep learning, such as all-reduce, broadcast, and other collective operations.
2. **Backends and Compatibility**: The package supports multiple backends like NCCL, MPI, and CCL, and aims to maintain compatibility with the torch.distributed API. It also allows using custom collectives and has a mechanism to switch between different backends based on the available accelerators.
3. **Logging and Profiling**: The code includes a comprehensive logging and profiling system (`CommsLogger`) for tracking the performance of communication operations. It has a timer system to measure the time taken for each operation and can be configured for different levels of verbosity and profiling.
4. **Process Group Management**: The `ProcessGroup` class represents a group of processes, and the package provides functions to initialize, destroy, and manage these groups. It also has functions like `is_initialized()` to check if the communication backend is set up.
5. **Public API**: The code defines a set of public functions that mimic the torch.distributed API, such as `broadcast()`, `all_gather()`, `reduce()`, and `all_reduce()`. These functions are decorated with `timed_op` to automatically log their execution time, making it easier to analyze performance.
