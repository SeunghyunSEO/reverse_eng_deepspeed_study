### Summary



* `flatten`: This function takes a vector of PyTorch tensors and flattens them into a single tensor. Importance: **[High]**
* `unflatten`: This function takes a flattened tensor and a vector of original tensors, and returns the original tensors, unflattened. Importance: **[High]**
* `PYBIND11_MODULE(TORCH_EXTENSION_NAME, m)`: This block sets up a Python C++ extension using Pybind11, exposing the `flatten` and `unflatten` functions to Python code. Importance: **[High]**
* `torch::utils::flatten_dense_tensors`: A utility function from PyTorch used by `flatten` to perform the actual flattening. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `torch::utils::unflatten_dense_tensors`: Another utility function from PyTorch used by `unflatten` to reverse the flattening process. Importance: **[Medium]** 

This codebase is a C++ extension for PyTorch that provides functions for flattening and unflattening dense tensors. The extension is built using Pybind11, which allows seamless integration with Python. The `flatten` function combines multiple tensors into a single, contiguous tensor, while `unflatten` restores the original tensor structure from the flattened tensor. These functions are useful for optimizing memory usage and computation in deep learning models, especially when working with large numbers of tensors or applying operations like batched matrix operations. The code is adapted from NVIDIA Apex and is licensed under Apache 2.0, with credit to both Microsoft and NVIDIA.

### Highlights



1. **File and purpose**: The code is part of a C++ file named `flatten_unflatten.cpp`, which is related to operations on tensors, specifically flattening and unflattening them. It is likely a part of a Python extension for a deep learning project, given the use of PyTorch's C++ API.
2. **Copyright and licensing**: The code has dual copyright, mentioning Microsoft Corporation and the DeepSpeed Team, and is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license. It also acknowledges that a portion of the code is adapted from NVIDIA/apex.
3. **Header includes**: The code includes necessary headers for tensor operations in PyTorch, such as `<torch/csrc/utils/tensor_flatten.h>` and `<torch/extension.h>`. This indicates that the code is designed to work with PyTorch's C++ API.
4. **Functions**: The code defines two functions:
5. `flatten(std::vector<at::Tensor> tensors)`: This function takes a vector of PyTorch tensors and returns a single flattened tensor using `torch::utils::flatten_dense_tensors()`.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a function to flatten a list of tensors
def flatten_tensors(tensors: List[Tensor]) -> Tensor:
    """
    Given a list of PyTorch tensors, this function returns a single tensor
    that has all the elements of the input tensors concatenated along a new dimension.

    Returns:
    - Tensor: A flattened tensor containing all the elements of the input tensors.
    """
    # Use PyTorch utility function to flatten the tensors
    return torch.utils.flatten_dense_tensors(tensors)

def unflatten_tensor(flat_tensor: Tensor, original_tensors: List[Tensor]) -> List[Tensor]:
    """
    Given a flattened tensor and the original list of tensors, this function
    returns a list of tensors with the same shape as the original list, where
    each tensor has been restored from the flattened tensor.

    - original_tensors (List[Tensor]): The original list of tensors for reference.

    """
    This function defines a Python module with two methods: 'flatten' and 'unflatten',
