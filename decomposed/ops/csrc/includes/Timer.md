This codebase contains two header file classes, `GPUTimer` and `CPUTimer`, which are used for measuring time intervals on a GPU and CPU, respectively. These classes are designed to provide high-resolution timing for performance profiling in CUDA-based applications. The `GPUTimer` class uses CUDA events to measure GPU time, while the `CPUTimer` class uses the `chrono` library from C++11 to measure CPU time. Both classes have methods to start, stop, and reset the timers, as well as to retrieve the elapsed time. The code is written for the DeepSpeed project, which is a deep learning optimization library, and these timers can be useful for optimizing the performance of GPU computations.

### Highlights



1. **Header Guard**: The code uses a preprocessor directive `#ifndef __TIMER_H__` and `#define __TIMER_H__` to ensure the file is only included once in the compilation process, preventing multiple definition errors.
2. **Namespace**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the code is part of the `DeepSpeed` team's work, which might imply that it's part of a larger project named "DeepSpeed."
3. **CUDA Inclusion**: The `GPUTimer` class interacts with NVIDIA CUDA, as seen by the inclusion of `<cuda_runtime.h>` and `<cuda.h>`. It uses `cudaEvent_t` to measure GPU timing.
4. **GPUTimer Class**: This class provides a simple interface to measure GPU time intervals. It has two member variables `start` and `stop` of type `cudaEvent_t`, and two methods: a constructor to create events, a destructor to destroy them, `Record()` to start the timer, and `Elapsed()` to calculate the elapsed time.
5. **CPUTimer Class**: This class measures CPU time intervals using C++11's `<chrono>` library. It has a single member variable `start` and two methods: a constructor to initialize the timer, `Reset()` to reset the timer, and `Elapsed()` to calculate the elapsed time since the last reset or construction.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Pseudocode for Timer.py

# Import necessary libraries
import time
import torch

# Define GPU Timer class
class GPUtimer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize CUDA events for start and stop
        self.start_event = torch.cuda.Event()
        self.stop_event = torch.cuda.Event()

    def __del__(self):
        # Destroy CUDA events when the object is garbage collected
        self.start_event.destroy()
        self.stop_event.destroy()

    def start(self):
        # Record the start event
        self.start_event.record()

    def elapsed(self):
        # Record the stop event and synchronize
        self.stop_event.record()
        torch.cuda.synchronize()
        # Calculate elapsed time in milliseconds
        time_elapsed = torch.cuda.EventElapsedTime(self.start_event, self.stop_event)
        return time_elapsed

# Define CPU Timer class
class CPUtimer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Record the start time at object creation
        self.start_time = time.perf_counter()

    def reset(self):
        # Reset the start time to the current time
        self.start_time = time.perf_counter()

    def elapsed(self):
        # Calculate the elapsed time since the last reset or object creation
        current_time = time.perf_counter()
        elapsed_time = (current_time - self.start_time) * 1000  # Convert to milliseconds
        return elapsed_time
