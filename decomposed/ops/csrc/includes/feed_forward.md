* `FeedForward`: A template class for a feed-forward neural network layer. Importance: **[High]**
* `FeedForward::Config`: A nested struct to hold configuration parameters for the feed-forward layer. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `FeedForward::Forward`: Implements the forward pass of the feed-forward layer using cuBLAS for GPU acceleration. Importance: **[High]**
* `FeedForward::Backward`: Implements the backward pass (gradient computation) for the feed-forward layer. Importance: **[High]**
* `cublas_gemm_ex`: A helper function to perform matrix multiplication using cuBLAS. Importance: **[Low]** (It's a helper function called within the class methods)
* `launch_fuse_transpose_bias_kernel`: A private, unimplemented function that likely performs a fused transpose and bias operation on the GPU. Importance: **[High]** (Although unimplemented, it's a key part of the backward pass)

This file `feed_forward.h` defines a C++ template class `FeedForward` for implementing a feed-forward neural network layer optimized for GPU computation using cuBLAS. The class has a forward pass method `Forward` and a backward pass method `Backward`, which are essential for the forward propagation and backpropagation in training a deep learning model. The configuration struct `Config` allows users to set up the layer with specific dimensions and algorithm choices. The `launch_fuse_transpose_bias_kernel` function, though unimplemented, suggests that it's designed to fuse certain operations for efficiency. The code is designed to work with both NVIDIA CUDA and AMD ROCm platforms.

### Highlights



1. **Header Guard**: The code uses preprocessor directives (`#ifndef`, `#define`, `#endif`) to create a header guard, which prevents multiple inclusion of the header file in a project.
2. **Template Class**: The `FeedForward` class is a template class, allowing it to work with different data types (`T`), such as `float` or `half` (half-precision floating-point).
3. **Configuration Structure**: The `FeedForward` class has a nested `Config` structure that holds the necessary parameters for the feed-forward layer, such as batch size, output size, input size, and gemm algorithms.
4. **CUDA Function Calls**: The class contains two member functions, `Forward` and `Backward`, which utilize CUDA's `cublas_gemm_ex` function for performing matrix multiplications (GEMM) with specified algorithms. This is a key aspect of the code, as it highlights its GPU-accelerated nature for efficient computation.
5. **Kernel Launch**: The `Backward` function calls a custom CUDA kernel, `launch_fuse_transpose_bias_kernel<T>`, for handling the transpose and bias operations in the backward pass of the feed-forward layer.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a class for FeedForward network with template type T
class FeedForward:
    # Define a nested structure for configuration
    class Config:
        def __init__(self, batch, outputs, inputs, gemm_algos):
            self.batch_size = batch
            self.output_size = outputs
            self.input_size = inputs
            self.gemm_algos = gemm_algos

    # Initialize FeedForward with a configuration
    def __init__(self, config: Config):
        self.config = config

    # Destructor for cleanup
    def __del__(self):
        pass

    # Forward pass through the feed-forward layer
    def forward(self, bsz, input_ptr, weights, out, cublas_handle):
        # Set alpha and beta values
        alpha, beta = 1.0, 0.0

        # Perform a transpose GEMM operation
        self._cublas_gemm(cublas_handle, CUBLAS_OP_T, CUBLAS_OP_N, alpha, beta, input_ptr, weights, out, self.config.gemm_algos[0])

    # Backward pass through the feed-forward layer
    def backward(self, bsz, out_grad, input_ptr, weights, weights_grad, bias_grad, cublas_handle, stream, inp_grad_out=None, out_grad_trans_out=None):
        # Set alpha and beta values
        alpha, beta = 1.0, 0.0

        # Perform the first GEMM operation for weights gradient
        self._cublas_gemm(cublas_handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_T, alpha, beta, input_ptr, out_grad, weights_grad, self.config.gemm_algos[1])

        # Perform the second GEMM operation for input gradient
        if inp_grad_out is not None:
            self._cublas_gemm(cublas_handle, CUBLAS_OP_N, CUBLAS_OP_N, alpha, beta, weights, out_grad, inp_grad_out, self.config.gemm_algos[2])

        # Launch a kernel to transpose and accumulate bias gradient
        self._launch_fuse_transpose_bias_kernel(out_grad, bias_grad, bsz, self.config.output_size, stream)

    # Helper function for GEMM operation (abstracted for readability)
    def _cublas_gemm(self, handle, op_a, op_b, alpha, beta, a, b, c, algo):
        # Perform the GEMM operation using the provided handles, operation types, and algorithm
        pass

    # Helper function for launching a kernel to transpose and accumulate bias gradient
    def _launch_fuse_transpose_bias_kernel(self, out_grad, bias_grad, bsz, output_size, stream):
        # Launch a CUDA kernel to perform the transpose and accumulate bias gradient
        pass
