<|im_end|>

* `DS_HD_INLINE`: Macro for defining a function as `__host__`, `__device__`, and `__forceinline__`. Importance : **[Low]** (It's a utility macro)
* `DS_D_INLINE`: Macro for defining a function as `__device__` and `__forceinline__`. Importance : **[Low]** (Similar to the above, but for device functions)
* `next_pow2`: A utility function that calculates the next power of 2 for a given integer value. Importance : **[Medium]** (Useful for memory alignment and optimization)
* `BF16_AVAILABLE`: Macro indicating if the system supports BFloat16. Importance : **[Low]** (Conditional compilation flag)
* `hw_warp_size`: A constant for the hardware warp size, either 32 for CUDA or 64 for HIP. Importance : **[Medium]** (Used for warp-level operations) 

This file, `ds_kernel_utils.h`, is a header file that provides a set of utility macros, constants, and functions for use in a CUDA or HIP-based codebase, likely part of the DeepSpeed library. It focuses on defining platform-specific configurations, such as warp size and half-precision support, and includes helper functions like `next_pow2` for computing the next power of 2. The macros are used to control function attributes and platform compatibility, while the constants are essential for GPU computations. The file is designed to be included in other source files to provide a consistent interface for common operations.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Header File**: This is a header file (`ds_kernel_utils.h`) that likely serves as an include for other source files in the DeepSpeed project, providing common definitions and utility functions.
2. **Copyright and License**: The code is copyrighted by Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
3. **Preprocessor Macros**: The file defines preprocessor macros for function attributes and constants, such as `DS_HD_INLINE` for functions that should be both host and device inline, `DS_D_INLINE` for device-only inline functions, and `HALF_PRECISION_AVAILABLE` to indicate if half-precision floating-point is supported.
4. **Platform-Specific Code**: The code detects the platform (NVIDIA HIP or CUDA) and includes the appropriate headers, defining constants like `hw_warp_size` (warp size for the platform) and enabling features like half-precision support or PTX availability based on the architecture.
5. **Utility Function**: The `next_pow2` function is an inline utility function that calculates the next power of 2 for a given integer value. This is useful for aligning memory or optimizing computations.

```python
# Constants and utility functions for DeepSpeed library, targeting CUDA and HIP platforms.

# Import equivalent libraries for Python
import numpy as np  # For hardware-independent data manipulation
from typing import Union  # For type hints

# Define platform-specific constants

    HW_WARP_SIZE = 64
    HALF_PRECISION_AVAILABLE = True
    COOPERATIVE_GROUPS_LIBRARY = "hip_cooperative_groups"
    FLOAT16_LIBRARY = "hip_fp16"
elif platform == "NVIDIA CUDA":
    HW_WARP_SIZE = 32
    HALF_PRECISION_AVAILABLE = CUDA_ARCH >= 530
    COOPERATIVE_GROUPS_LIBRARY = "cooperative_groups"
    FLOAT16_LIBRARY = "cuda_fp16"
    ASYNC_COPY_AVAILABLE = CUDA_ARCH >= 800

def next_power_of_2(val: int) -> int:
    """
    Given an integer 'val', returns the next power of 2 greater than or equal to 'val'.
    """
    rounded_val = val - 1
    # Bitwise operations to set all lower bits to 1
    for shift in [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]:  # Adjust according to the maximum possible bit shift
        rounded_val |= rounded_val >> shift
    return rounded_val + 1
