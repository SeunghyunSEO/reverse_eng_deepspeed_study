This file contains a set of template functions and a class for memory access utilities in CUDA. It focuses on loading and storing data from/to global and shared memory with different cache policies, as well as providing asynchronous memory copy functionality for CUDA kernels. The code is designed for efficient data movement in GPU computations, particularly for the DeepSpeed library. The importance of the functions depends on the specific use case and whether asynchronous memory copy is being utilized.

### Highlights



1. **Memory Access Enums**: The code defines two enums, `LoadPolicy` and `StorePolicy`, which represent caching policies for memory access in a GPU environment. These enums define how data should be cached when loading from or storing to memory, with options like `CacheAll`, `CacheGlobal`, and `CacheStreaming`.
2. **Template Functions**: The code contains a large number of template functions for loading and storing data from/to global and shared memory with different access sizes (4, 8, 16 bytes) and caching policies. These functions are designed to be used on a GPU and utilize CUDA assembly (`asm volatile`) for efficient memory operations.
3. **Async Memory Copy**: If the `ASYNC_COPY_AVAILABLE` macro is defined, the code provides asynchronous memory copy functions (`memcpy_async`, `memcpy_async_nop`, `memcpy_async_zero`, and their variants) for copying data between shared and global memory. These functions use CUDA's cache-prefetch instructions for efficient data transfer.
4. **BufferTracker Class**: The `BufferTracker` template class is designed to manage pipeline buffers. It has a single member `current_state`, and a `get()` function that increments and wraps the state, allowing for tracking of buffer indices in a pipeline.
5. **Utility Functions**: The code includes utility functions like `lane_id()` which returns the lane ID of the executing thread in a warp. This is useful for coordinating threads in a GPU.
