This file is part of a CUDA C++ library for performing quantization operations on tensors, specifically for deep learning. It provides classes and functions to handle quantization parameters, track statistics for quantization groups, and perform the actual quantization and dequantization of data. The library supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with different bit widths. The code is optimized for GPU execution, using CUDA-specific intrinsics and memory access utilities. The main purpose is to efficiently convert floating-point data into lower precision integers for storage or computation, while maintaining accuracy.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Header Inclusions and Namespace**: The code starts with the necessary header inclusions, such as `<cassert>` and other utility headers defined within the project. It also defines a `DS_D_INLINE` macro and uses the `quantize` namespace.
2. **Quantization Parameters Class**: The `Params` class template is defined to handle quantization operations for different bit widths and types (Symmetric and Asymmetric). It contains methods for quantization, dequantization, and storing/retrieving parameters from memory.
3. **Specializations for Symmetric and Asymmetric Quantization**: The `Params` class is specialized for `Symmetric` and `Asymmetric` quantization, each with its own constructor, quantization, dequantization, and storage methods. The scale and offset are calculated differently based on the quantization type.
4. **Group Statistics Classes**: The `GroupStats` class template is specialized for `Symmetric` and `Asymmetric` quantization to track the necessary statistics for quantization. Each specialization has methods for updating statistics, reducing data within a thread block, and calculating quantization parameters.
5. **Device Functions and Loops**: The code includes device functions like `_chunk` for quantizing data, `_local_serial_reduce` for serial reduction, and `local_array` for the main quantization loop. These functions handle the actual data processing, utilizing CUDA concepts like thread blocks and warps.
