### Summary



* `launch_fused_add2`: A template function that performs a fused addition operation on two input tensors, storing the result in an output tensor. It takes four pointers (for input and output) and dimensions (batch size, sequence length, hidden size) along with a CUDA stream for asynchronous execution. Importance: **[High]**
* `launch_fused_add4`: Similar to `launch_fused_add2`, but for a fused addition of four input tensors. It has the same parameters with an additional input tensor. Importance: **[High]**
* `launch_fused_add3`: A template function for a fused addition of three input tensors, with the same parameter structure as the other two. Importance: **[High]**
* `THREADS`: A constant defining the number of threads per block in a CUDA kernel, set to 256. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `TILE_DIM`: A constant defining the tile size for memory operations, set to 32. Importance: **[Medium]** 

This file, `general_kernels.h`, is a header file for CUDA C++ that contains template functions for performing fused addition operations on tensors. These functions are designed for GPU-accelerated computations, likely used in deep learning contexts, specifically for optimizing performance in tasks like training or inference. The functions are generic, supporting different data types (`T`) and use CUDA streams for efficient memory management and parallel execution. The file also includes necessary CUDA and HIP (for AMD GPUs) headers, as well as custom headers for context and cuBLAS wrappers. The `minus_infinity` and `FINAL_MASK` constants might be used for specific computations within the kernel functions.

### Highlights



1. **File and Header Inclusions**: This code is a header file `general_kernels.h` for a C++/CUDA project, dealing with GPU-accelerated operations. It includes necessary headers for CUDA, HIP (for AMD GPU compatibility), and custom headers like `context.h` and `cublas_wrappers.h`.
2. **Macros**: There are several macros defined, such as `THREADS` and `TILE_DIM`, which are commonly used for defining thread block and tile dimensions in CUDA kernels. `minus_infinity` is a floating-point negative infinity, and `FINAL_MASK` is a 32-bit unsigned integer mask.
3. **Conditional Compilation**: The code uses `#ifdef __HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__` to conditionally include HIP headers for AMD GPU platform, and otherwise includes NVIDIA's `cooperative_groups.h`. This ensures platform compatibility.
4. **Template Functions**: The code defines three template functions for fused addition operations:
5.   - `launch_fused_add2`: This function performs a fused addition of two input tensors into an output tensor, using CUDA streams for asynchronous execution.
