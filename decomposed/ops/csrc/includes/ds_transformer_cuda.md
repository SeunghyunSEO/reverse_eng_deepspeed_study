This file `ds_transformer_cuda.h` defines a CUDA implementation of a Bert Transformer layer for deep learning, specifically designed for the DeepSpeed library. The class `BertTransformerLayer` encapsulates the computations for the self-attention and feed-forward sub-layers, along with dropout and normalization operations. The class supports both forward and backward passes, and it is optimized for performance with CUDA and cuBLAS. The template parameter `T` allows for different data types (e.g., float, half). The file also includes various utility classes and headers for CUDA, cuBLAS, and other deep learning operations.

### Highlights



1. **Header File**: This is a C++ header file (`ds_transformer_cuda.h`) that likely defines the interface for a CUDA implementation of a BertTransformerLayer for deep learning, specifically for the DeepSpeed library.
2. **Includes**: The code includes various CUDA and NVIDIA libraries (e.g., `cuda_runtime_api.h`, `cublas_v2.h`, `curand.h`) for GPU computations, as well as custom data structures and functions related to deep learning operations.
3. **Struct**: The `BertGemmAlgos` struct holds integer values for different gemm (general matrix multiplication) algorithms, which are used for optimizing computations.
4. **Template Class**: The `BertTransformerLayer<T>` is a template class that represents a single layer of the BERT model. It has a constructor with numerous parameters for configuring the layer, and it provides `Forward` and `Backward` methods for the forward pass and backward pass (gradient computation) in the training process. It also has utility methods like `SetIntermediateBuffers`, `GetBatchSize`, `GetNumHeads`, etc.
5. **Private Members**: The class has private member variables that store the layer's configuration, handles to CUDA resources, and various layers (feed-forward, normalization, softmax, etc.) that make up the transformer layer. There are also flags for memory-saving techniques and performance optimization.
