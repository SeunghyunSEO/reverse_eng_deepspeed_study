This file `softmax.h` is a header file for a C++ implementation of a softmax operation optimized for GPU computation using CUDA. The `Softmax` class provides a template-based interface for performing forward and backward softmax computations on tensors. The class also includes a configuration struct for specifying parameters like batch size, number of heads, sequence length, and probability depth. The forward and backward operations are launched as CUDA kernels, which are likely defined in a separate CUDA source file (e.g., `softmax.cu`). The class is designed to be used in the context of deep learning, possibly for attention mechanisms in models like Transformers.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Header and Copyright Information**: The code starts with a copyright notice and a reference to the Microsoft Corporation, indicating the ownership and licensing terms (Apache-2.0).
2. **Includes and Namespaces**: The code includes several header files, such as `<cuda.h>`, `<cuda_fp16.h>`, `<stdio.h>`, and `"custom_cuda_layers.h"`, which are necessary for CUDA and C++ functionality. The `using namespace std` statement is used to avoid having to prefix standard library objects with `std::`.
3. **Template Class `Softmax`**: The main class `Softmax` is defined with a template parameter `T`, allowing it to work with different data types. It contains a nested `struct Config` for storing configuration parameters like batch size, heads, sequence length, and probability depth.
4. **Member Functions**: The `Softmax` class has two primary member functions:
5. - `Forward`: This function performs the forward pass of the softmax operation using a CUDA kernel (`launch_attn_softmax<T>`). It takes the batch size, input values, attention mask, and a CUDA stream as parameters.
