### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Header File**: This is a C++ header file (`quantization.h`) that likely defines functions and structures related to quantization, a process used in deep learning for reducing precision and memory usage.
2. **Namespaces**: The code uses a namespace `quantize`, which encapsulates quantization-related types and functions.
3. **Enums and Structs**: The `quantize` namespace includes an `enum class` `Type` with two options: `Symmetric` and `Asymmetric`, representing different quantization types. There's also a `struct PackedInt4` for packing 4 bits of data into an 8-bit integer.
4. **Inlined Functions**: The `DS_HD_INLINE` macro is used to declare an inline function `requires_offset()`, which checks if a quantization type requires an offset.
5. **Kernel Launches**: The code defines several function signatures for launching CUDA kernels, which are responsible for quantization, dequantization, and related operations on GPU data. These functions handle different data types, bit widths, and group sizes, indicating they are designed for flexible and efficient processing of large datasets.
