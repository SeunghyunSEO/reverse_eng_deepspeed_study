### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `do_aio_operation_sequential`: Executes an asynchronous I/O operation (read or write) sequentially. Importance: **[High]**
* `do_aio_operation_overlap`: Executes an asynchronous I/O operation (read or write) with overlap, potentially for better performance. Importance: **[High]**
* `open_file`: Opens a file for reading or writing, returning an error code. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `report_file_error`: Reports an error related to a file operation, including the filename, operation, and error code. Importance: **[Low]**
* `regular_read`: Reads data from a file into a buffer. Importance: **[Medium]**

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Header File**: This is a C++ header file (`deepspeed_aio_common.h`) that likely defines functions and structures for use in other source files within the "ops/csrc/aio/common" directory. It's part of the DeepSpeed library, which is a deep learning optimization library.
2. **Copyright and License**: The code is copyrighted by Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which is a permissive open-source license.
3. **Functionality**: The code provides functionality for asynchronous I/O (AIO) operations, specifically for swapping optimizer tensors between memory and NVMe storage devices. This is crucial for efficient data handling in deep learning workloads.
4. **Functions**: There are several key functions defined:
5. - `do_aio_operation_sequential` and `do_aio_operation_overlap`: These functions perform AIO operations in sequential and overlapping modes, respectively, indicating they handle I/O operations with different synchronization strategies.
