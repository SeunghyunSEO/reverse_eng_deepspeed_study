<|im_end|>

* `io_xfer_ctxt`: A struct representing the context for I/O transfer operations, containing file descriptor, base offset, memory buffer, and number of bytes to transfer. Importance: **[High]**
* `io_prep_context`: A struct for preparing I/O control blocks (iocbs) for operations, with information about read/write, transfer context, block size, and a pointer to the iocb vector. Importance: **[High]**
* `io_prep_generator`: A struct to generate iocbs for I/O operations, managing the remaining bytes, number of I/O blocks, and next iocb index. Importance: **[High]**
* `ds_page_aligned_alloc`: A function to allocate page-aligned memory with an optional locking option. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `get_file_size`: A utility function to get the size of a file. Importance: **[Medium]** 

This codebase provides functionality for asynchronous I/O operations, specifically for swapping optimizer tensors to and from NVMe storage devices. It includes utilities for memory allocation, file size retrieval, and preparing I/O control blocks for efficient data transfer. The main focus is on optimizing the interaction with storage devices for deep learning workloads, likely as part of the DeepSpeed library. The code is designed to handle large data transfers efficiently by using structures like `io_xfer_ctxt`, `io_prep_context`, and `io_prep_generator`.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Header File**: This is a C++ header file (`deepspeed_aio_utils.h`) that likely provides utility functions for asynchronous I/O operations, specifically related to swapping optimizer tensors between memory and NVMe storage devices.
2. **Copyright and License**: The code is copyrighted by Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
3. **Includes**: The code includes a mix of standard C and C++ libraries, such as `<fcntl.h>`, `<libaio.h>`, `<sys/mman.h>`, and `<iostream>`, which are crucial for file operations, asynchronous I/O, memory management, and input/output operations.
4. **Structures**: The code defines three custom structures:
5.   - `io_xfer_ctxt`: Represents the context for I/O transfers, containing file descriptor, base offset, memory buffer, and number of bytes to transfer.
