### Summary



* `deepspeed_aio_latency_t`: A struct for storing latency statistics, including minimum, maximum, and average latencies in microseconds. Importance: **[High]**
* `dump`: A method of `deepspeed_aio_latency_t` to print latency statistics with a given tag. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `accumulate`: A method of `deepspeed_aio_latency_t` to accumulate latency statistics from another `deepspeed_aio_latency_t` instance. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `scale`: A method of `deepspeed_aio_latency_t` to scale latency statistics by a given value. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `deepspeed_aio_perf_t`: A struct for storing performance metrics, including submission and completion latency, end-to-end latency, and rate in GB/s. Importance: **[High]**

### Highlights



1. **Header File**: This is a C++ header file (`deepspeed_aio_types.h`) that defines various structs and utility functions related to asynchronous I/O operations, specifically for tensor swapping with NVMe storage devices.
2. **Copyright and License**: The code is copyrighted by Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
3. **Structures**: The code defines three main structs:
4.   - `deepspeed_aio_latency_t`: This struct represents latency statistics, with fields for minimum, maximum, and average latency in microseconds. It also has methods for dumping the stats, accumulating new stats, and scaling the values.
5.   - `deepspeed_aio_perf_t`: This struct combines latency stats for submission and completion (`_submit` and `_complete`) and includes end-to-end latency (`_e2e_usec`) and rate (`_e2e_rate_GB`).
