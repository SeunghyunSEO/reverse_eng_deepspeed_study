### Summary



* `pre_handle`: Prepares for I/O operations (read or write) by creating an AsyncIOBuilder handle, allocating a tensor, and setting up context. Importance: **[High]**
* `pre_handle_read`: A specialized version of `pre_handle` for reading operations. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `pre_handle_write`: A specialized version of `pre_handle` for writing operations. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `post_handle`: Releases resources after I/O operations by detaching and nullifying the buffer. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `main_parallel_read`: Executes parallel read operations using the aio handle. Importance: **[High]**

### Highlights



1. **File operations with NVMe storage**: The code is designed to handle I/O operations (reading and writing) with NVMe storage devices. It uses the `AsyncIOBuilder` to create an asynchronous I/O handle for efficient data transfer.
2. **Multi-threaded execution**: The code utilizes the `multiprocessing.Pool` to parallelize tasks across multiple threads. It uses barriers (`Barrier`) to synchronize tasks at specific points in the execution.
3. **Task scheduling**: The `get_schedule` function dynamically determines which functions to use for preprocessing (`pre`), main operation (`main`), and postprocessing (`post`) based on whether the operation is a read or write and whether parallel I/O is enabled.
4. **Buffer management**: The code allocates and manages tensors in memory, either on GPU or CPU, depending on the configuration. It also handles buffer detachment and release after operations.
5. **Performance measurement**: The code tracks elapsed time for each task and calculates aggregate metrics for reporting results (`report_results`). This is useful for benchmarking and optimizing I/O performance.
