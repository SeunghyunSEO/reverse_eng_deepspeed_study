### Highlights



1. **Header Inclusions**: The code includes necessary headers for the functionality it provides, such as `torch/extension.h` for PyTorch extensions and `deepspeed_py_aio_handle.h` and `deepspeed_py_copy.h` for the custom DeepSpeed functionality.
2. **Module Definition**: The `PYBIND11_MODULE` macro is used to define a Python module named `TORCH_EXTENSION_NAME`. This allows the C++ code to be exposed to Python, with the functions `aio_read`, `aio_write`, and `deepspeed_memcpy` being registered for use in Python.
3. **deepspeed_aio_handle_t Class**: A Python wrapper class is defined for `deepspeed_aio_handle_t`, which exposes various methods for interacting with asynchronous I/O operations. This class allows initializing handles, getting attributes, and performing read, write, and pread/pwrite operations (both synchronous and asynchronous).
4. **Memory Management**: The class `deepspeed_aio_handle_t` also includes methods for managing CPU-locked tensors, such as `new_cpu_locked_tensor` and `free_cpu_locked_tensor`, which are likely related to efficient memory handling between CPU and storage devices.
5. **Asynchronous Operations**: The key functionality of this code revolves around asynchronous I/O operations, which are essential for efficient data transfer to and from storage devices, particularly NVMe devices. The various read and write methods (e.g., `read`, `write`, `pread`, `pwrite`, `sync_` and `async_` variants) enable non-blocking operations, improving performance.
