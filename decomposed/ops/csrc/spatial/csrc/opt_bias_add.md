This codebase is a CUDA implementation for optimized bias addition operations on half-precision (FP16) data. It contains three kernel functions (`opt_bias_add`, `opt_bias_add_add`, `opt_bias_add_bias_add`) that perform different variations of bias addition, and a helper function (`launch_opt_bias_add`) to launch the appropriate kernel based on the input tensors. The code is designed for efficient GPU computation, using optimized memory access patterns and thread organization. The namespace `badd_opt` holds constants that define the optimization parameters for these operations.

### Highlights



1. **Namespace and Constants**: The code defines a namespace `badd_opt` containing constants used for optimization, such as thread block size (`threads`), number of steps (`steps`), and data access granularity (`granularity`). These constants are used to define the size and stride of memory accesses.
2. **CUDA Kernel Functions**: There are three `__global__` functions, `opt_bias_add`, `opt_bias_add_add`, and `opt_bias_add_bias_add`, which are CUDA kernel functions. These functions are executed in parallel on the GPU to perform fused bias addition operations on half-precision floating-point data (`__half` and `__half2`). The operations involve adding bias to an activation tensor, optionally adding another tensor, and another bias.
3. **Memory Access Utilities**: The `mem_access::load_global` and `mem_access::store_global` functions are used to efficiently load and store data from/to global memory in chunks of `badd_opt::granularity`. This is an optimization technique to reduce memory transaction overhead.
4. **Launch Function**: The `launch_opt_bias_add` function is responsible for launching the appropriate CUDA kernel based on the availability of `other` and `other_bias` tensors. It calculates the grid and block dimensions for the kernel launch and includes a safety check to ensure the channel size is divisible by the number of values per half.
5. **Error Checking and Assertions**: The code uses `assert` statements to ensure that certain conditions are met before executing the kernels, such as the channel size being divisible by `badd_opt::vals_per_h`. This helps catch potential issues at runtime.
