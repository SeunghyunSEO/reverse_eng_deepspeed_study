This file, `spatial_inference.py`, is part of the DeepSpeed library, which is a high-performance deep learning optimization library. It defines a custom CUDA operation builder, `SpatialInferenceBuilder`, that specializes in spatial inference operations. The class handles tasks such as checking system compatibility, managing source and header files, and providing the necessary setup for building the CUDA operation. The code is designed to work with PyTorch and has specific requirements for CUDA compatibility, especially for newer GPU architectures. The overall purpose of this file is to enable efficient spatial inference within DeepSpeed's framework.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Inheritance**: The `SpatialInferenceBuilder` class is a subclass of `CUDAOpBuilder`, which indicates that it specializes in building CUDA operations related to spatial inference.
2. **Constants**: The class defines two class-level constants, `BUILD_VAR` and `NAME`, which are used to identify the build variable and the name of the operation, respectively.
3. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the class with a default name if none is provided, inheriting the `NAME` constant.
4. **Compatibility Check**: The `is_compatible` method checks if the system has the necessary dependencies, specifically `torch` for PyTorch, and a compatible CUDA version. It issues warnings if the requirements are not met and returns a boolean indicating compatibility.
5. **Source Files and Include Paths**: The `sources` and `include_paths` methods define the source code files and include directories needed to build the CUDA operation. These are likely the implementation files for the spatial inference functionality.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a class for building spatial inference operations
class SpatialInferenceBuilder:
    # Class constants
    BUILD_VAR = "DS_BUILD_SPATIAL_INFERENCE"
    NAME = "spatial_inference"

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name=None):
        # Set the name, defaulting to class constant if not provided
        self.name = self.NAME if name is None else name
        # Inherit from CUDAOpBuilder and initialize with the given name
        super().__init__(name=self.name)

    # Method to get the fully qualified module name
    def absolute_name(self):
        # Return the module path with the class NAME
        return f'deepspeed.ops.spatial.{self.NAME}_op'

    # Method to check compatibility with the environment
    def is_compatible(self, verbose=True):
        # Check if torch is installed
        try:
            import torch
        except ImportError:
            # Print a warning and return False if torch is not installed
            self.warning("Please install torch if trying to pre-compile inference kernels")
            return False

        # Check CUDA compatibility
        cuda_okay = True
        if not self.is_rocm_pytorch() and torch.cuda.is_available():
            # Get system and torch CUDA versions
            sys_cuda_major, _ = installed_cuda_version()
            torch_cuda_major = int(torch.version.cuda.split('.')[0])
            # Get the CUDA capability of the first GPU
            cuda_capability = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).major

            # Check compatibility for Ampere and higher architectures
            if cuda_capability >= 8:
                if torch_cuda_major < 11 or sys_cuda_major < 11:
                    self.warning("On Ampere and higher architectures please use CUDA 11+")
                    cuda_okay = False

        # Return the result of the compatibility check, considering both base class and CUDA
        return super().is_compatible(verbose) and cuda_okay

    # Method to list source files for the operation
    def sources(self):
        # Return a list of source files
        return [
            'csrc/spatial/csrc/opt_bias_add.cu',
            'csrc/spatial/csrc/pt_binding.cpp',
        ]

    # Method to list include paths for the operation
    def include_paths(self):
        # Return a list of include paths
        return ['csrc/spatial/includes', 'csrc/includes']
```
