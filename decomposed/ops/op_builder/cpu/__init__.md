### Summary



* `CCLCommBuilder`: Constructs a communication builder for Collective Communication Library (CCL) in CPU-based operations. Importance: **[High]**
* `FusedAdamBuilder`: Implements a fused version of the Adam optimizer for CPU, which can improve performance. Importance: **[High]**
* `CPUAdamBuilder`: Builds the CPU-specific Adam optimizer. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `NotImplementedBuilder`: A placeholder class indicating that a particular operation is not implemented for the CPU. Importance: **[Low]**
* `__init__.py`: This is the initialization file for the `cpu` subdirectory within the `op_builder` module. It imports and exposes the mentioned classes for use in the DeepSpeed library. Importance: **[Low]** (It's more about organization than functionality)

This codebase is part of the DeepSpeed library, specifically focusing on operator builders for CPU operations. It provides classes for building communication, optimization, and other operations that are tailored for CPU-based computations. The main focus is on efficient implementations of the Adam optimizer, with both fused and non-fused versions, and a basic communication builder for collective operations using CCL. The `NotImplementedBuilder` class is a utility to signal when a certain operation is not supported on the CPU.

### Highlights



1. **File Structure**: The code is part of a Python package, specifically `ops/op_builder/cpu/`, indicating that it's related to CPU-specific operations for a library or framework, possibly DeepSpeed.
2. **Copyright and Licensing**: The file includes copyright information and a license identifier (`SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0`), which is the Apache License 2.0, a permissive open-source license.
3. **Authorship**: The code is credited to the "DeepSpeed Team" and has an additional comment crediting "The Microsoft DeepSpeed Team", suggesting a connection to Microsoft's DeepSpeed project, which is a deep learning optimization library.
4. **Imports**: The code imports several classes from sub-modules within the same package:
5.   - `CCLCommBuilder` from `.comm`
