### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `CPUAdamBuilder`: This is a class that extends the `CPUOpBuilder` class and is specifically designed for building the CPU implementation of the Adam optimizer. Importance: **[High]**
* `__init__`: The constructor for `CPUAdamBuilder`, initializes the class with the name 'cpu_adam'. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `absolute_name`: Returns the fully qualified name for the CPUAdam operator within the DeepSpeed library. Importance: **[Low]**
* `sources`: Lists the source files required to build the CPUAdam operator. Importance: **[Low]**
* `libraries_args`: Inherently calls the `libraries_args` from the parent class, likely to add any necessary libraries for building the operator. Importance: **[Low]** (as it's a simple delegation)
* `include_paths`: Specifies the include paths for the header files needed during the build process. Importance: **[Low]**

This file, `cpu_adam.py`, is part of the DeepSpeed library, which is a high-performance training library for deep learning. It defines a custom builder class, `CPUAdamBuilder`, for the CPU version of the Adam optimization algorithm. The class is responsible for managing the build process, including specifying source files, include paths, and any required libraries. This allows DeepSpeed to compile and utilize a custom CPU implementation of the Adam optimizer during training, potentially improving performance on systems without a GPU or when GPU resources are limited.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **File structure and purpose**: The code is part of a Python file named `cpu_adam.py`, which is located in the `ops/op_builder/cpu/` directory. It seems to be part of a project called DeepSpeed, and it deals with implementing the CPU version of the Adam optimizer.
2. **Copyright and licensing**: The file starts with a copyright notice and indicates that it is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.
3. **Class Inheritance**: The `CPUAdamBuilder` class is defined, which inherits from the `CPUOpBuilder` class. This suggests that it is responsible for building the CPU-specific implementation of the Adam optimization algorithm.
4. **Class Variables**: The class has two class variables, `BUILD_VAR` and `NAME`, which define constants related to the builder. `BUILD_VAR` is a flag for whether to build the CPU Adam module, and `NAME` gives the module a unique identifier.
5. **Methods**: The `CPUAdamBuilder` class has several methods:

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a module for CPU-specific Adam optimization operation builder
class CPUAdamBuilder:
    # Class constants
    BUILD_VAR = "DS_BUILD_CPU_ADAM"  # Environment variable to check if building is enabled
    NAME = "cpu_adam"  # Unique identifier for the CPU Adam operation

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self):
        # Inherit from the base class CPUOpBuilder and initialize with the class's unique name
        super().__init__(name=self.NAME)

    # Method to generate the fully qualified module name
    def absolute_name(self):
        # Return the module path for the CPU Adam operation
        return f'deepspeed.ops.adam.{self.NAME}_op'

    # Method to list source files required for building the operation
    def sources(self):
        # Return the list of source files needed for CPU Adam implementation
        return ['csrc/adam/cpu_adam.cpp', 'csrc/adam/cpu_adam_impl.cpp']

    # Method to specify additional libraries and arguments for building
    def libraries_args(self):
        # Inherit the base class's libraries arguments and return them
        args = super().libraries_args()
        return args

    # Method to define include paths for the build process
    def include_paths(self):
        # Return the path to the header files needed for CPU Adam operation
        return ['csrc/includes']
```
