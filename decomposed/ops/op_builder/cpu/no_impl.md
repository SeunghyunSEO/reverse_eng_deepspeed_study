### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `NotImplementedBuilder`: This is a class that extends the `CPUOpBuilder` class. It is used to represent an operation that is not implemented for the CPU backend in DeepSpeed. Importance: **[High]**
* `__init__`: The constructor for the `NotImplementedBuilder` class, which initializes the object with a default or user-specified name. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `absolute_name`: Returns the full name of the operation in the DeepSpeed library, indicating it's not implemented. Importance: **[Low]**
* `load`: A method that raises a `ValueError` when called, as the operation is not implemented on the CPU. Importance: **[High]**
* `sources`: Returns an empty list, as there are no source files for an unimplemented operation. Importance: **[Low]** 

**Description of the file:**

The `cpu/no_impl.py` file in the DeepSpeed codebase contains the `NotImplementedBuilder` class, which is a part of the `CPUOpBuilder` system. This class is specifically designed to handle cases where an operation is not supported or implemented for the CPU backend. When an instance of `NotImplementedBuilder` is used, it will raise an error when attempting to load or use the operation, making it clear to users that the functionality is not available. The file serves as a placeholder or a way to handle missing features gracefully in the DeepSpeed library for CPU-based computations.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **File and Module Structure**: The code is part of a Python file named `cpu/no_impl.py`, which suggests it's related to CPU-specific operations within a larger project (DeepSpeed). It imports `CPUOpBuilder` from a sibling module `ops/op_builder/builder.py`.
2. **Copyright and License**: The file starts with a copyright notice and a SPDX-License-Identifier, indicating the Apache 2.0 license, which governs the usage and distribution of the code.
3. **Class Definition**: The main class defined is `NotImplementedBuilder`, which inherits from `CPUOpBuilder`. This class represents an operation that is not implemented for the CPU backend.
4. **Class Attributes**: `NotImplementedBuilder` has two class attributes: `BUILD_VAR` and `NAME`. These constants define the build variable and the name of the operation, respectively.
5. **Method Implementations**: The class has three methods:

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a module for CPU operation builders
class CPUOpBuilder:
    # Base class for CPU operation builders
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    # Method to get the absolute name of the operation
    def absolute_name(self):
        pass  # To be implemented by subclasses

    # Method to load the operation
    def load(self, verbose=True):
        pass  # To be implemented by subclasses

    # Method to get the source files for the operation
    def sources(self):
        pass  # To be implemented by subclasses


# Define a class for "Not Implemented" CPU operation
class NotImplementedBuilder(CPUOpBuilder):
    # Class constants
    BUILD_VAR = "DS_BUILD_NOT_IMPLEMENTED"
    NAME = "deepspeed_not_implemented"

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self, name=None):
        # If no name is provided, use the class constant
        name = self.NAME if name is None else name
        # Initialize the parent class
        super().__init__(name=name)

    # Override the absolute_name method
    def absolute_name(self):
        # Return the absolute name with the class constant
        return f'deepspeed.ops.comm.{self.NAME}_op'

    # Override the load method to raise an error
    def load(self, verbose=True):
        # Raise a ValueError indicating the operation is not implemented on CPU
        raise ValueError("This op has not been implemented on CPU backend.")

    # Override the sources method to return an empty list
    def sources(self):
        # Return an empty list since there are no sources for this unimplemented op
        return []
```
