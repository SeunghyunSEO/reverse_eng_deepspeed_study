* `CCLCommBuilder`: A class for building a communication operation specific to Collective Communications Library (CCL) on CPU. Importance: **[High]**
* `__init__`: Constructor for the `CCLCommBuilder` class, initializes the class with a default or specified name. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `absolute_name`: Returns the fully qualified name for the CCL communication operation. Importance: **[Low]**
* `sources`: Lists the source files required for building the CCL communication operation. Importance: **[Low]**
* `include_paths`: Returns the include paths needed for the C++ compilation. Importance: **[Low]** 
* `cxx_args`: Provides the C++ compiler arguments for optimization and OpenMP support. Importance: **[Low]**
* `is_compatible`: Checks if the system is compatible for building the CCL communication operation. Currently, it simply calls the parent class's method. Importance: **[Low]**
* `extra_ldflags`: Returns the linker flags to include the CCL library when building the operation. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `CPUOpBuilder`: A parent class for building CPU operations, not defined in this file but referenced. Importance: **[间接高]**

This file is part of the DeepSpeed library, specifically focusing on building a communication operation for CPU using the Collective Communications Library (CCL). The `CCLCommBuilder` class handles the necessary steps for compiling and linking the C++ source code that interfaces with CCL, which is a library for high-performance communication in distributed deep learning. The class provides methods for specifying source files, include paths, compiler flags, and linker flags, as well as checking compatibility with the system. The ultimate goal is to enable efficient communication between multiple GPUs or nodes in a distributed training setup.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Module and Class Definition**: This code defines a Python class `CCLCommBuilder` which inherits from `CPUOpBuilder`. The class is part of the `op_builder/cpu/comm.py` module and is related to communication operations for DeepSpeed, a deep learning acceleration library.
2. **Constants**: The class has two class-level constants, `BUILD_VAR` and `NAME`, which are used to identify the build variable and the name of the communication operation, respectively.
3. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method initializes the class with an optional `name` parameter, defaulting to the class's `NAME` constant.
4. **Builder Methods**: The class implements several builder methods for the operation:
5. - `absolute_name`: Returns the fully qualified name of the operation.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a module for communication operations on CPU, using CCL (Collective Communication Library)
class CommModuleBuilder:
    # Class constants
    BUILD_VAR = "DS_BUILD_CCL_COMM"  # Environment variable to check for build configuration
    NAME = "deepspeed_ccl_comm"  # Default name of the communication module

    def __init__(self, name=None):
        # Initialize the builder with a custom name if provided, otherwise use the default
        self.name = self.NAME if name is None else name
        self._super_init()  # Call the base class's constructor (CPUOpBuilder)

    def absolute_name(self):
        # Return the fully qualified name of the operation
        return f'deepspeed.ops.comm.{self.NAME}_op'

    def sources(self):
        # List the source files required for building the operation
        return ['csrc/cpu/comm/ccl.cpp']

    def include_paths(self):
        # Specify the include directories for the build process
        return ['csrc/cpu/includes']

    def cxx_args(self):
        # Define the compiler flags for optimization and OpenMP support
        return ['-O2', '-fopenmp']

    def is_compatible(self, verbose=True):
        # Check if the system is compatible for building the operation
        # TODO: Implement a soft compatibility check for private binary release
        return super().is_compatible(verbose)  # Call the base class's compatibility check

    def extra_ldflags(self):
        # Get the CCL library path from the environment, and return the necessary linker flags
        ccl_root_path = os.environ.get("CCL_ROOT")
        if ccl_root_path is None:
            raise ValueError(
                "CCL_ROOT not found. Install oneCCL and source its environment variables."
            )
        else:
            return ['-lccl', f'-L{ccl_root_path}/lib']
```
