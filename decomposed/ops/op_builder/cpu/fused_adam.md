This file, `cpu/fused_adam.py`, is part of the DeepSpeed library, which is a high-performance training accelerator for PyTorch. It defines a custom `FusedAdamBuilder` class that extends the `CPUOpBuilder` class. The `FusedAdamBuilder` is used to build an optimized CPU implementation of the Adam optimizer, called "fused_adam". The class provides methods to specify the source code files and include paths needed for the compilation of the custom operator. This allows DeepSpeed to efficiently integrate the fused Adam optimizer into the training process for improved performance.

### Highlights



1. **File and Module Structure**: The code is part of a Python file named `cpu/fused_adam.py`, which suggests it's related to a specific implementation of an operation (in this case, FusedAdam) for CPU operations within a larger library or framework, possibly called DeepSpeed.
2. **Copyright and Licensing**: The code is copyrighted by Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which is an open-source license.
3. **Inheritance**: The `FusedAdamBuilder` class inherits from `CPUOpBuilder`. This indicates that it extends or specializes the functionality of the base class for building the FusedAdam optimizer.
4. **Class Definition**: The `FusedAdamBuilder` class has a few class-level attributes (`BUILD_VAR` and `NAME`) and defines methods like `__init__`, `absolute_name`, `sources`, and `include_paths`. These methods are related to the setup and build process of the FusedAdam operator, specifying its name, source files, and include directories for compilation.
5. **Method Implementations**: The methods in the `FusedAdamBuilder` class provide information about the custom operation. `absolute_name` returns the fully qualified name for the operation, `sources` lists the C++ source files needed to build it, and `include_paths` specifies the directories containing the necessary header files.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a module for building CPU operations, specifically focused on fused Adam optimizer
class CPUOpBuilder:
    # Class variable to store the build flag
    BUILD_VAR = None
    # Class variable to store the operation name
    NAME = None

    # Constructor to initialize the CPUOpBuilder with a given operation name
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    # Returns the fully qualified name for the operation
    def absolute_name(self):
        return f'deepspeed.ops.adam.{self.name}_op'

    # Returns a list of source files required to build the operation
    def sources(self):
        return []

    # Returns a list of include paths for the required header files
    def include_paths(self):
        return []


# Specialize the CPUOpBuilder for the FusedAdam optimizer
class FusedAdamBuilder(CPUOpBuilder):
    # Set the build flag and operation name for FusedAdam
    BUILD_VAR = "DS_BUILD_FUSED_ADAM"
    NAME = "fused_adam"

    # Override the constructor to use the class-specific NAME
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name=self.NAME)

    # Override the source files for FusedAdam
    def sources(self):
        return ['csrc/cpu/adam/fused_adam.cpp', 'csrc/adam/cpu_adam_impl.cpp']

    # Keep the same include paths as the base class
    def include_paths(self):
        return ['csrc/includes']
```
