### Highlights



1. **File and Module Structure**: The code is part of a Python project for building and managing custom operations (ops) for DeepSpeed, a deep learning acceleration library. The file is located in `ops/op_builder/builder.py`, indicating it's part of the `op_builder` module.
2. **Error Handling and Dependencies**: The code checks for the presence of required libraries like `torch` and `cuda`, raising exceptions if they are not found or if there is a version mismatch. It also handles `ImportError` for `torch` and `MissingCUDAException` and `CUDAMismatchException` for CUDA-related issues.
3. **OpBuilder Class**: The `OpBuilder` class is defined, which is an abstract base class (ABC) using the `abstractmethod` decorator. It provides a framework for building and managing custom operations, with methods like `absolute_name()`, `sources()`, and `is_compatible()`. It also has utility methods for handling CUDA compatibility, version checks, and file operations.
4. **CUDA Support**: The code has extensive support for CUDA, including functions to check the installed CUDA version, compute capabilities, and compatibility with PyTorch. There is a separate `CUDAOpBuilder` class that extends `OpBuilder` for building CUDA-based operations, handling NVCC compiler flags, and compute capability arguments.
5. **Helper Functions**: The code includes several helper functions for managing file paths, compiling and linking, and checking for function existence in libraries. It also has utility functions for managing CPU architecture, SIMD width, and CPU flags.
