This file, `cpu_adagrad.py`, is part of the DeepSpeed library and is responsible for building the CPU version of the Adagrad optimization operator. It uses the `TorchCPUOpBuilder` class to create the custom operation, defining the source files, library dependencies, and include paths required for the build. The class `CPUAdagradBuilder` extends the base class to specialize the build process for the Adagrad algorithm, which is a popular optimization method for training deep learning models. The code is designed to handle both CPU and GPU builds, depending on the configuration.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Namespace and Dependencies**: The code is part of the "DeepSpeed" project, which is a library for efficient deep learning training. It imports necessary modules like `os` and `TorchCPUOpBuilder` from a relative path, indicating it's part of a larger codebase with custom components.
2. **Class Definition**: The `CPUAdagradBuilder` class is defined, which inherits from `TorchCPUOpBuilder`. This class is specifically for building the CPU version of the Adagrad optimization algorithm.
3. **Class Variables**: The class has two class variables, `BUILD_VAR` and `NAME`, which define constants related to the build configuration and the name of the operation.
4. **Methods**: The class has several methods that define the behavior for building the Adagrad operator:
5.   - `__init__`: Initializes the class with the operation's name.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a module for CPU-specific Adagrad operation builder
class CPUAdagradBuilder:
    # Class constants
    BUILD_VAR = "DS_BUILD_CPU_ADAGRAD"  # Environment variable to check if Adagrad should be built
    NAME = "cpu_adagrad"  # Unique name for the Adagrad operation

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self):
        # Inherit from the base TorchCPUOpBuilder and set the operation name
        super().__init__(name=self.NAME)

    # Method to get the fully qualified name of the operation
    def absolute_name(self):
        # Return the module path for the Adagrad operation
        return f'deepspeed.ops.adagrad.{self.NAME}_op'

    # Method to determine source files needed for building
    def sources(self):
        if self.build_for_cpu:
            # Return CPU-specific source file
            return ['csrc/adagrad/cpu_adagrad.cpp']
        else:
            # Return both CPU and CUDA source files
            return ['csrc/adagrad/cpu_adagrad.cpp', 'csrc/common/custom_cuda_kernel.cu']

    # Method to gather library arguments for the build process
    def libraries_args(self):
        # Inherit base library arguments
        args = super().libraries_args()

        if self.build_for_cpu:
            # No additional libraries needed for CPU build
            return args
        elif not self.is_rocm_pytorch():
            # Add 'curand' library for CUDA builds (except for ROCm PyTorch)
            args += ['curand']
        return args

    # Method to define include paths for the build process
    def include_paths(self):
        import torch

        if self.build_for_cpu:
            # No CUDA include path needed for CPU build
            CUDA_INCLUDE = []
        elif not self.is_rocm_pytorch():
            # Add CUDA include path for non-ROCM PyTorch builds
            CUDA_INCLUDE = [os.path.join(torch.utils.cpp_extension.CUDA_HOME, "include")]
        else:
            # No CUDA include path for ROCm PyTorch builds
            CUDA_INCLUDE = []

        # Always include the base include path
        return ['csrc/includes'] + CUDA_INCLUDE
