This file is part of the DeepSpeed library, specifically focusing on the implementation of a fused Adam optimizer for CUDA. The `FusedAdamBuilder` class is responsible for building the CUDA operation for an optimized version of the Adam optimizer, which is a widely used optimization algorithm in deep learning. The class handles the necessary source files, include paths, and compiler arguments to build the custom CUDA operator, ensuring it's tailored for the specific platform and version of PyTorch being used. The fused Adam optimizer aims to improve performance by combining multiple operations into a single CUDA kernel.

### Highlights



1. **Inheritance**: The `FusedAdamBuilder` class is a subclass of `CUDAOpBuilder`, which indicates that it is designed to build a specific CUDA operation related to Adam optimization.
2. **Constants**: The class defines two class-level constants, `BUILD_VAR` and `NAME`, which are used to identify the build variable and the name of the fused Adam operation, respectively.
3. **Initialization**: The `__init__` method is overridden to set the `name` attribute to `self.NAME`, which is consistent with the class's purpose.
4. **Functional Methods**: The class has several methods that define the necessary components for building the CUDA operation:
5. - `absolute_name`: Returns the fully qualified name of the operation.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a class for building a fused Adam CUDA operation
class FusedAdamBuilder:
    # Class constants
    BUILD_VAR = "DS_BUILD_FUSED_ADAM"  # Environment variable for build flag
    NAME = "fused_adam"  # Name of the operation

    # Initialize the FusedAdamBuilder with the class name
    def __init__(self):
        super(FusedAdamBuilder, self).__init__(name=self.NAME)

    # Return the fully qualified name of the operation
    def absolute_name(self):
        return f'deepspeed.ops.adam.{self.NAME}_op'

    # List the source files required for building the operation
    def sources(self):
        return ['csrc/adam/fused_adam_frontend.cpp', 'csrc/adam/multi_tensor_adam.cu']

    # Specify the include paths for the source files
    def include_paths(self):
        return ['csrc/includes', 'csrc/adam']

    # Add C++ compiler arguments, including version-dependent macros
    def cxx_args(self):
        base_args = super(FusedAdamBuilder, self).cxx_args()
        return base_args + self.version_dependent_macros()

    # Define NVCC compiler arguments, including platform-specific and performance flags
    def nvcc_args(self):
        flags = ['-O3'] + self.version_dependent_macros()

        # Platform-specific and performance flags for non-ROCM PyTorch
        if not self.is_rocm_pytorch():
            platform_flags = ['-allow-unsupported-compiler'] if sys.platform == "win32" else []
            performance_flags = ['-lineinfo', '--use_fast_math']
            flags.extend(platform_flags + performance_flags + self.compute_capability_args())

        return flags
