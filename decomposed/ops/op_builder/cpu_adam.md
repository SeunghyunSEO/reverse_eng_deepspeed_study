This file, `cpu_adam.py`, is part of the DeepSpeed library. It defines a class, `CPUAdamBuilder`, which is responsible for building the CPU implementation of the Adam optimization algorithm. The class provides methods to manage the build process, including specifying source files, library dependencies, and include paths. This is crucial for integrating the custom CPU Adam optimizer into the DeepSpeed framework, allowing users to leverage this optimizer during training on CPU.

### Highlights



1. **Namespace and Dependencies**: The code is part of the "DeepSpeed" project, which is a library for efficient deep learning training. It imports `os` and `TorchCPUOpBuilder` from a relative path, indicating it's related to building custom operations for deep learning on the CPU using PyTorch.
2. **Inheritance**: The `CPUAdamBuilder` class inherits from `TorchCPUOpBuilder`. This suggests that it is a specialized class for building an optimized CPU version of the Adam optimizer, a popular optimization algorithm for training deep learning models.
3. **Class Variables**: The class has two class variables, `BUILD_VAR` and `NAME`, which define constants related to the build configuration and the name of the operation being built, respectively.
4. **Methods**: The class defines several methods that are crucial for the build process:
5.   - `__init__`: Initializes the class with the operation's name.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a module for CPU-specific Adam optimization operator builder
class CPUAdamBuilder:
    # Class constants
    BUILD_VAR = "DS_BUILD_CPU_ADAM"  # Environment variable to check if builder should be enabled
    NAME = "cpu_adam"  # Name of the operator

    # Constructor
    def __init__(self):
        # Inherit from the base TorchCPUOpBuilder and set the operator name
        super().__init__(name=self.NAME)

    # Get the fully qualified name of the operator
    def absolute_name(self):
        return f'deepspeed.ops.adam.{self.NAME}_op'

    # Determine source files to be compiled
    def sources(self):
        if self.build_for_cpu:  # If building for CPU
            return ['csrc/adam/cpu_adam.cpp', 'csrc/adam/cpu_adam_impl.cpp']
        else:  # If building for GPU or both
            return ['csrc/adam/cpu_adam.cpp', 'csrc/adam/cpu_adam_impl.cpp', 'csrc/common/custom_cuda_kernel.cu']

    # Gather library arguments for the build process
    def libraries_args(self):
        # Inherit base library arguments
        args = super().libraries_args()

        if not self.build_for_cpu:  # If not building specifically for CPU
            if not self.is_rocm_pytorch():  # If using CUDA (not ROCm)
                args += ['curand']  # Add 'curand' library

        return args

    # Define include paths for the build process
    def include_paths(self):
        import torch

        if self.build_for_cpu:  # If building for CPU
            CUDA_INCLUDE = []  # No CUDA headers needed
        else:  # If building for GPU or both
            if not self.is_rocm_pytorch():  # If using CUDA (not ROCm)
                CUDA_INCLUDE = [torch.utils.cpp_extension.CUDA_HOME / "include"]  # Add CUDA include path
            else:
                CUDA_INCLUDE = []  # No CUDA headers needed for ROCm

        return ['csrc/includes'] + CUDA_INCLUDE  # Return combined include paths
