This file is the entry point for the `op_builder` module in a DeepSpeed library. It initializes and manages the op builders, which are responsible for creating custom operations for deep learning accelerators. The file sets up the available op builders by importing and registering them, and it provides a way to create an op builder instance based on the current accelerator. The `OpBuilder` class is a core component, and the `builder_closure` function is crucial for dynamically providing the appropriate op builder at runtime or during installation. The `get_default_compute_capabilities` function helps in setting up default hardware capabilities for the operations.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **Namespace and Package Management**: The code is part of the `op_builder` module in the `ops` package of a project, likely related to DeepSpeed. It sets up the package structure and imports necessary modules.
2. **Conditional Import and Detection**: The code attempts to import `deepspeed.ops.op_builder` and uses it if available. If not, it defaults to using the local `op_builder` module. This is a way to handle both installation and runtime scenarios.
3. **`__op_builders__` and `__deepspeed__`**: The `__op_builders__` list is initialized but not populated in this code. It seems to be intended for storing available op builders. The `__deepspeed__` variable is a flag to indicate the presence of a DeepSpeed-related op builder.
4. **`builder_closure` Function**: This function is a closure that dynamically creates an op builder based on the `member_name` provided. It checks the `op_builder_dir` to decide whether to return a builder directly or a function that will create a builder at runtime.
5. **Reflection and Builder Registration**: The code uses `pkgutil.iter_modules` to iterate through sub-modules in the `op_builder` directory. For each module, it checks for classes ending with "Builder" and excludes a few specific cases. It then assigns a closure to a variable with the same name as the class, effectively creating a callable that returns an op builder instance.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define the main module and import necessary libraries
import necessary_libraries

# Define constants and default values
DEFAULT_COMPUTE_CAPABILITIES = get_default_compute_capabilities()
OP_BUILDER_DIR = determine_op_builder_directory()

# Set a flag for DeepSpeed compatibility
IS_DEEPSPEED = True

# Initialize an empty list for op builders
OP_BUILDERS = []

# Define a function to create a builder closure
def builder_closure(member_name):
    if OP_BUILDER_DIR == "op_builder":
        # If during installation, return a closure to create the builder later
        def _builder():
            from accelerator_module import get_accelerator
            return get_accelerator().create_op_builder(member_name)
        return _builder
    else:
        # If during runtime, directly return the op builder
        from accelerator_module import get_accelerator
        return get_accelerator().get_op_builder(member_name)

# Reflect builder classes and assign them as closures
for module_info in iterate_over_modules_in_directory(op_builder_dir):
    module_name = module_info.name
    if module_name not_in ['all_ops', 'builder']:
        import_module = import_module(module_name, op_builder_dir)
        
        for member_name in module_members(module_info.module):
            if member_name.endswith('Builder') and member_name not_in ['OpBuilder', 'CUDAOpBuilder']:
                # Create a closure for the builder and assign it to a variable with the same name
                create_variable(member_name, builder_closure(member_name))

# The pseudocode ends here
```
