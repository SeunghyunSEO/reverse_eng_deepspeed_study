### Summary

<|im_end|>

* `nhwc_bias_add`: This is the main function that performs the operation of adding biases to NHWC (NCHW) formatted tensors. It uses a spatial CUDA module for optimized inference. Importance: **[High]**
* `SpatialInferenceBuilder`: A class that is responsible for building and loading the spatial CUDA module for optimized operations. Importance: **[Medium]** (Although not directly defined in this file, it's crucial for the main function's operation.)
* `global spatial_cuda_module`: A global variable that holds the loaded spatial CUDA module. Importance: **[Low]** (It's a supporting variable for the main function.)
* `if spatial_cuda_module is None`: This conditional block initializes the spatial CUDA module if it's not already loaded. Importance: **[Low]** (Supporting logic for the main function.)
* `return spatial_cuda_module.nhwc_bias_add*`: These return statements call the appropriate CUDA module functions based on the input arguments. Importance: **[Medium]** (They handle the actual computation.) 

This file is part of a DeepSpeed library, specifically focusing on an inference operation for bias addition in a tensor. It provides an optimized CUDA implementation for adding biases to activation tensors in the NHWC format, which is commonly used in convolutional neural networks. The function `nhwc_bias_add` handles different scenarios based on the presence of additional tensors and biases, and it leverages a pre-built CUDA module for improved performance.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **File and Module Structure**: The code is part of a file named `bias_add.py` within a specific directory structure (`ops/transformer/inference`). This suggests it's a utility for performing a specific operation, in this case, bias addition, in a deep learning context.
2. **Copyright and Licensing**: The code has a copyright notice and a license identifier (Apache-2.0), indicating the terms under which the code can be used and distributed.
3. **Imports**: The code imports necessary modules, including `typing` for type hints, `torch` for tensor operations, and `deepspeed.ops.op_builder` for a custom operation builder. The `SpatialInferenceBuilder` is used to load a custom CUDA module.
4. **Global Variable**: The `spatial_cuda_module` is a global variable initialized as `None`. It is used to store a loaded CUDA module for performing optimized operations.
5. **`nhwc_bias_add` Function**: This is the main function of the code, which takes `activation`, `bias`, `other`, and `other_bias` tensors as inputs. It uses the `spatial_cuda_module` to perform different bias addition operations based on the presence or absence of `other` and `other_bias` tensors. It demonstrates a conditional flow for different variations of bias addition.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# Define a module for bias addition in NHWC format, leveraging DeepSpeed's SpatialInferenceBuilder
class BiasAddModule:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the module by loading the necessary CUDA operations
        self.spatial_cuda_module = self.load_spatial_inference_builder()

    def load_spatial_inference_builder(self):
        # Load the SpatialInferenceBuilder module for optimized operations
        return SpatialInferenceBuilder().load()

    def nhwc_bias_add(self, activation, bias):
        # Perform bias addition on NHWC formatted activation tensor with a bias tensor
        return self.spatial_cuda_module.nhwc_bias_add(activation, bias)

    def nhwc_bias_add_add(self, activation, bias, other):
        # Perform bias addition and element-wise addition on NHWC formatted tensors
        return self.spatial_cuda_module.nhwc_bias_add_add(activation, bias, other)

    def nhwc_bias_add_bias_add(self, activation, bias, other, other_bias):
        # Perform bias addition and bias addition on NHWC formatted tensors
        return self.spatial_cuda_module.nhwc_bias_add_bias_add(activation, bias, other, other_bias)


# Global variable to store the loaded CUDA module
bias_add_module = None


def perform_bias_addition(activation, bias, other=None, other_bias=None):
    # Initialize the BiasAddModule if not already initialized
    global bias_add_module
    if bias_add_module is None:
        bias_add_module = BiasAddModule()

    # Call the appropriate method based on the provided arguments
    if other is None:
        # Basic bias addition
        return bias_add_module.nhwc_bias_add(activation, bias)
    elif other_bias is None:
        # Bias addition followed by element-wise addition
        return bias_add_module.nhwc_bias_add_add(activation, bias, other)
    else:
        # Bias addition with two bias tensors
        return bias_add_module.nhwc_bias_add_bias_add(activation, bias, other, other_bias)
```
