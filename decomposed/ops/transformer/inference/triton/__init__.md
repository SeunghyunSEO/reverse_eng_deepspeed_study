This file, `__init__.py`, is part of a module in a codebase that focuses on inference operations for a transformer model, likely related to natural language processing (NLP). The module provides essential building blocks for the transformer model, including functions for residual connections, layer normalization, activation functions (GELU), softmax, and optimized matrix multiplication operations. These functions are crucial for the efficient computation and inference of transformer models, which are widely used in deep learning tasks like language translation and text generation. The codebase is likely part of a larger library or framework, such as DeepSpeed, which is designed to optimize the training and inference of deep learning models.

### Highlights



1. **File Structure**: The code is part of a Python package, specifically `ops/transformer/inference/triton/__init__.py`. This file is likely the entry point for the `triton` module within the `inference` subdirectory, which deals with operations related to transformers, possibly for deep learning inference.
2. **Copyright and License**: The code is copyrighted by Microsoft Corporation and is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. This is an important legal aspect that governs how the code can be used, modified, and distributed.
3. **Module Imports**: The code imports several functions and modules from within the same package. These include:
4. `residual_add_bias`: A function for adding residual bias in transformer layers.
5. `layer_norm` and `layer_norm_residual`: Functions for performing layer normalization, a common technique in deep learning.
