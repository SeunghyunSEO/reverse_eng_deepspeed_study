<|im_end|>

* `gpt_sample_tokens`: A function for sampling tokens, likely specific to the GPT model. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `bert_sample_tokens`: A function for sampling tokens, tailored for the BERT model. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `GatherTokens`: A class that likely deals with gathering tokens, potentially for parallel processing or data manipulation. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `ScatterTokens`: A class responsible for scattering tokens, possibly for distributing data across multiple processes or devices. Importance: **[Medium]**
* `__init__.py`: This is the initialization file for the `random_ltd` module, which imports the mentioned functions and classes, making them accessible to other parts of the codebase. Importance: **[Low]** 

This codebase seems to be focused on providing utilities for token manipulation, specifically designed for GPT and BERT models. The `gpt_sample_tokens` and `bert_sample_tokens` functions are for sampling tokens during pre-processing or training, while `GatherTokens` and `ScatterTokens` classes are likely used for organizing and distributing these tokens, possibly for efficient computation or parallelization. The codebase is part of a larger project, possibly related to deep learning and natural language processing (NLP), given the mention of Microsoft DeepSpeed Team, which is a popular library for optimizing deep learning training.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **File structure and location**: The code is part of a Python package named `random_ltd`, specifically in the `__init__.py` file. This indicates that it is the entry point for the `random_ltd` package, making the functions defined or imported here accessible when the package is imported.
2. **Copyright and license information**: The code includes a copyright notice and a reference to the SPDX-License-Identifier, which is Apache-2.0. This tells us that the code is licensed under the Apache License version 2.0, which governs how the code can be used, modified, and distributed.
3. **Authorship**: The comment mentions the "DeepSpeed Team," which is likely the team responsible for developing or maintaining the code. DeepSpeed is a popular deep learning optimization library.
4. **Imports**: The code imports three functions from the `dropping_utils` module: `gpt_sample_tokens`, `bert_sample_tokens`, and two classes, `GatherTokens` and `ScatterTokens`. These are likely utility functions or classes related to token manipulation, possibly for tasks like data preprocessing or model training, specifically tailored for GPT and BERT models.
5. **Namespace**: By importing these functions directly in the `__init__.py` file, they become part of the `random_ltd` package's public API. Users can access them using `random_ltd.gpt_sample_tokens`, `random_ltd.bert_sample_tokens`, `random_ltd.GatherTokens`, and `random_ltd.ScatterTokens`.
