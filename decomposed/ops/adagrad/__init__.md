This codebase, specifically the `__init__.py` file, is part of the DeepSpeed library and focuses on providing a CPU-optimized implementation of the Adagrad optimization algorithm. The main class, `DeepSpeedCPUAdagrad`, allows users to leverage Adagrad for training deep learning models on CPU hardware efficiently. The file serves as an entry point to access this optimizer within the DeepSpeed framework.

### Highlights

<|im_end|>

1. **File Location and Purpose**: The code is part of a Python module `ops/adagrad/__init__.py`. This typically indicates that it is the initialization file for the `adagrad` subpackage within the `ops` package. The `__init__.py` file is used to make the `adagrad` directory a Python package.
2. **Copyright and License Information**: The code includes a copyright notice and specifies the SPDX-License-Identifier as Apache-2.0. This is important for understanding the legal terms under which the code can be used, modified, and distributed.
3. **Attribution**: The code mentions the "DeepSpeed Team," which likely refers to the developers or maintainers of the codebase. DeepSpeed is a popular deep learning acceleration library.
4. **Import Statement**: The code imports the `DeepSpeedCPUAdagrad` class from the submodule `cpu_adagrad`. This class is likely an implementation of the Adagrad optimization algorithm optimized for CPU-based computations.
5. **Module Structure**: The code doesn't contain any additional functionality beyond the import statement. This suggests that the main purpose of this `__init__.py` file is to make the `DeepSpeedCPUAdagrad` class available to users when they import the `adagrad` package.

### Pythonic Pseudocode

```python
# File: ops/adagrad/__init__.py

# Comment: This file serves as the entry point for the Adagrad optimization module in the DeepSpeed library.
# It is responsible for importing and exposing the Adagrad implementation for CPU devices.

# Import the custom CPU implementation of DeepSpeed Adagrad optimizer
from custom_adagrad_module import DeepSpeedCPUAdagrad as _DeepSpeedCPUAdagrad

# Comment: The following line is a naming convention to expose the imported class with a more intuitive name
DeepSpeedCPUAdagrad = _DeepSpeedCPUAdagrad

# Comment: By default, the '__init__.py' file makes the 'DeepSpeedCPUAdagrad' class available to users
# when they import the 'ops/adagrad' package, allowing them to utilize the Adagrad optimizer for CPU devices.
